"Well, this just got interesting.","I'm supposed to have the Essure implant procedure on Friday. I have the day off for my pre op tomorrow and the day of the procedure itself. Pretty cool that it's on my payday, which I have direct deposit for so this is going to be the most memorable payday ever, right?

Well, I woke up a few times last night freaking out. Totally forgot that nickel was one of the material samples in a skin allergy test panel I had done about 5 years ago through a dermatologist. So I called them the moment their office opened today... because I couldn't remember a thing from the results. 

Yep. Bullet dodged. ""You just had a mild reaction though...""

I can't allow myself to have the Essure implant. A fragment of nickel taped to my back for a few days is nothing. But an implant is forever. I called the clinic I got approved through and I'm waiting to hear back from them.

I sure hope I can still get SOMETHING done on Friday, just different tools on the surgeon's cart! I'm so close to my victory. SO. CLOSE! This clinic either removes the entire tube or clamps it. Those are my only other options. It would be worth it to me since I've never had children and getting to this point was already nerve-wracking.

NYS Sterilization Question :),"Hey everyone! I'm kind of new to this sub (not to reddit- just a new account), so I apologize if this has ever been asked before. I'm a female in my early twenties, and my entire life, I have been 300% sure that I do not want children. I'm not interested in ever having children, nor do I really even like children much, hence my wandering over to /r/childfree. 

Despite being on birth control for more than three years, and taking it RELIGIOUSLY each day, I've, unfortunately, wound up pregnant a couple times. As I said, I do not want children, so this has been a seriously rocky rollercoaster for me. 

I've come to determine that birth control pills are just not going to cut it anymore. I've looked into getting an IUD implanted, as well as a few other options. At this point, a tubal ligation truly seems like the best option to me. I was wondering if anyone on this sub could provide me with any information about the sterilization laws in New York. I've been told (by family members) that you have to wait until the age of 30, or you have to have two kids before they can preform one. I haven't been able to find much information online about it and was hoping maybe some of you would be able to help. :)

Thanks so much!

Update: So I've looked around in my area and found an all female practice that lists Essure and laparoscopic tubal ligation as some of the procedures offered. I'm planning on calling tomorrow to schedule my first appointment with them! If I like the doctor and staff, I'm planning to ask about permanent/long-term options and (hopefully!) make some plans for the procedure. Otherwise, I'll keep looking for another gynecologist until I find one I love and can deal with for a while. :) Thanks so much to the few of you who answered me and clarified some things for me.

"Had Essure procedure yesterday, went horseback riding today.","Modern medicine is just awesome. 
anyway, ask me anything!

My experience is overwhelmingly positive so far - 
This is the worst of it: I had tremors from the anesthesia for a bit when I woke up, and horrible cramps for about 2 hours, and pretty bad cramps for about another hour. Took a nap and woke up a half hour later mostly feeling ok. Waves of light cramps throughout the evening. I was able to do things around the house but mostly took it easy. And that's it! I woke up this morning feeling right as rain, didn't feel like I should hold back from normal activities, even went horseback riding despite my sense of common sense telling me that was not a good plan. But it caused no pain! 

There was a small amount of bleeding yesterday and just a hint of it today. 
[edit: that small amount of bleeding continues, and it's 5 days later. I also should have mentioned that I've been on Depo-Provera for 2 years, with no period most of the time, so there's not much in there to bleed out. If that wasn't the case, I reckon this could be pretty bad. I read that often doctors put patients on Depo for a short time before the procedure, to reduce uterine lining if possible].

Unfortunately, the doctor is not completely satisfied with the placement of one of the coils, but seems confident that it will work anyway. I really like that there is a 12-week verification to show whether or not it worked as expected! (Otherwise, this situation would NOT be ok). 

Anyway, there's a lot of horror stories around, so I just thought I'd share my positive experience.

'You'll probably change your mind later' people are starting to get to me.,"I'm 28, and pretty much dead set on not having children, and I've been the same way for quite some time now. The whole thing (pregnancy, childbirth, being responsible for another life, etc.) freaks me out and does not sound appealing. It's just not something I want to do. 

And like many here, I hate hearing the whole 'you're still young, you might change your mind on it later' spiel. Even though I get frustrated/annoyed when it hear it, I get it. I understand what they're saying. I've seen examples of it happening with the people in my life, people change...I get it. I'm not a psychic, I can't read the future, so yes... I agree that it's possible that I may change my mind (even though I can't see it ever happening). So I find myself often saying now, 'I understand there's a possibility I might change my mind, but I am set on not having kids and have been for some time. That's where I am now and I honestly don't see that changing anytime'. (I guess I'm hoping that if I bring it up first, the other person won't.)

The thought that I might change my mind or a situation might arise that will cause me doubts, worries me. Not only worries, it almost terrifies me. Don't get me wrong, it's not like I stay up at night worrying about this and I stress over it constantly, but every now and then it comes up. Particularly when I have to explain why I am or want to be childfree. Like yesterday I was talking to a friend, and she used to be the same way but she's slowly becoming more open to the idea of being a parent. I actually told her that I'm so firm on this, that if it was an easy process , I would get my tubes tied now (or get essure), just to guarantee that I do not procreate. If I regret it in the future, too bad, present me doesn't care and thinks it would be for the best anyway. But the truth is, even if it were an easy thing (for a women who doesn't have kids to get her tubes tied or essure), I'm not even 100% sure I would go through with it now. So what does that say? (I do have an IUD, so I am on some kind of birth control.)

And yeah, I know I'm probably way over thinking here, what can I say, I'm definitely an overthinker/worrier. heh I've had the 'why I'm childfree' conversations a few times now, and I guess all the people who keep telling me that I'll change is starting to get to me. It shouldn't, but it kinda is. When I say people are getting to me, I don't mean I'm starting to question my childfree stance so much as I'm starting to really believe that I will most likely will change my mind later. Which, I don't like... I don't even like entertaining the idea of me changing my mind.

I've been browsing this sub for awhile, so I know some of you are so confident in your position that you know without a doubt that you will never change your mind. But there has to be someone else on here that feels the same way I do... that the future is uncertain and there's just no way for sure you can guarantee you'll never change your mind. So I guess I'm looking for solidarity of some sort. Any other childfree person here gone through similar doubts/worries?

Essure under 30?,Just curious -- has any one had the Essure procedure done who's under 30? ,childfree,2014-04-07 17:19:53,curious one procedure done,,Essure under 30? Just curious -- has any one had the Essure procedure done who's under 30? ,curious one procedure done
OKAY! First essure consultation is scheduled! Anyone wanna give me some pointers on what to say?,"Hi guys! I'd been doing some research online lately for doctors that seemed like they would be willing to perform an Essure procedure on a 24 year old woman. I came across one about an hour and a half away who is also an abortion doctor. I hadn't called around any other local areas for it because, well, I live in a small conservative town and all those other places are also in nearby small conservative towns. I figured it would just be a waste of time. Also, the fact that the doctor I'd called had a lot of positive reviews online and is (obviously) a huge advocate for pro-choice, I figured he'd be more compliant with my wishes. Made the call, explained myself to the receptionist. As soon as I told her my age, she was immediately reluctant to even make the appointment for me (""I don't think the doctor would be willing to perform it when you're so young and don't have kids""). I told her about my family history of cancer and other genetic issues and she put me on hold to ask the doctor. He said he would have me come in for a consultation to sit down to talk with me about it personally. This has me worried that he maybe isn't as ""liberal"" as I had hoped. SO. This question is mostly for those of you who had been successful in getting sterilization done, but what kinds of things have you told your doctor to get approved?  
I dislike children A LOT. I know for sure I want none and I've held this stance for as long as I can remember. I've never wavered on it. I grew up in foster care and figure that if, at any point, I ever go crazy and think I might want  a child I would just become a foster mother (more as a reminder of why I hate kids in the first place) before deciding to adopt one (I am a HUGE proponent of adoption). I have many different genetic issues that run on both sides of my family. Cancer, huntington's disease, hidradenitis suppurativa, autism, SIDS, addiction, and a myriad of mental health issues. Do I bring up all these? Would the mention of my own mental health issues be more detrimental than helpful in being approved? I am definitely of sound mind personally, but I'm worried that a mention of past mental health problems might make him change his mind on that. I've mentioned he is also an abortion doctor, should I mention that he would essentially be my first place to go in the incidence that I ever DO end up pregnant? I've never been on birth control (I don't feel safe taking anything hormonal), would this also be a problem to them? Thank you for any help you guys can give me!

First essure consultation is scheduled! Anyone wanna give me some pointers on what to say? Hi guys! I'd been doing some research online lately for doctors that seemed like they would be willing to perform an Essure procedure on a 24 year old woman. I came across one about an hour and a half away who is also an abortion doctor. I hadn't called around any other local areas for it because, well, I live in a small conservative town and all those other places are also in nearby small conservative towns. I figured it would just be a waste of time. Also, the fact that the doctor I'd called had a lot of positive reviews online and is (obviously) a huge advocate for pro-choice, I figured he'd be more compliant with my wishes. Made the call, explained myself to the receptionist. As soon as I told her my age, she was immediately reluctant to even make the appointment for me (""I don't think the doctor would be willing to perform it when you're so young and don't have kids""). I told her about my family history of cancer and other genetic issues and she put me on hold to ask the doctor. He said he would have me come in for a consultation to sit down to talk with me about it personally. This has me worried that he maybe isn't as ""liberal"" as I had hoped. SO. This question is mostly for those of you who had been successful in getting sterilization done, but what kinds of things have you told your doctor to get approved?  
I dislike children A LOT. I know for sure I want none and I've held this stance for as long as I can remember. I've never wavered on it. I grew up in foster care and figure that if, at any point, I ever go crazy and think I might want  a child I would just become a foster mother (more as a reminder of why I hate kids in the first place) before deciding to adopt one (I am a HUGE proponent of adoption). I have many different genetic issues that run on both sides of my family. Cancer, huntington's disease, hidradenitis suppurativa, autism, SIDS, addiction, and a myriad of mental health issues. Do I bring up all these? Would the mention of my own mental health issues be more detrimental than helpful in being approved? I am definitely of sound mind personally, but I'm worried that a mention of past mental health problems might make him change his mind on that. I've mentioned he is also an abortion doctor, should I mention that he would essentially be my first place to go in the incidence that I ever DO end up pregnant? I've never been on birth control (I don't feel safe taking anything hormonal), would this also be a problem to them? Thank you for any help you guys can give me! I'm really hoping this goes through and I don't end up having to search for another doctor or go through some long string of doctors to find one that will take my insurance and approve me.

About to go talk to my doctor about sterilization,"In less than an hour, I've got an appointment with my doctor to talk to her about the possibility of getting my tubes tied. I'm incredibly nervous, because I'm in the south and in my mid-twenties, so I'm expecting to get bingoed immediately. I'm prepared to argue my case, though, and ask for a referral if I have to.

Wish me luck, r/childfree! I'll update this post when I get back.

&amp;nbsp;

**UPDATE:**

Oh my god, that went even better than I could have hoped! I went in, bracing for the worst. I was even Googling rates of sterilization regret while in the waiting room, in case I had to actually argue statistics or something. But nothing like that was even necessary.


She came in, asked me about my implant and suggested a few other methods. I gave her my reasons against them, which was admittedly easier because I've already been treated for VVS in the same clinic, and that had already said that I shouldn't do the shot, and anything in the vagina (so NuvaRing, the strings from an IUD, etc.) wouldn't be good, either. She asked how long my husband and I had been together and if we had talked. I answered her (married a year, together for 8 and yes, we've talked), and she was satisfied. She said, ""You're 25, you seem like you've thought a lot about this and you've talked it over with your husband. I wouldn't have a problem doing it.""


She said that she would actually think it was better if he got a vasectomy instead of me doing anything because of my assorted issues (I've got a tipped uterus, too). She was also saying that, if we changed our minds, it would be really easy to get a sperm donor with similar education, build, etc. (I tried really hard not to look at her like she had lobsters crawling out of her ears). I told her thanks, but that I'd rather do it to myself than to him. So then we talked about the methods offered there (elastic band [maybe the Falope ring?] and Essure), and she gave me a brochure for each one to take home and discuss with my husband. When I've decided which one is for me, I can call back to set up another appointment.


So needless to say, I'm stoked! [This was me after my appointment](http://i.imgur.com/8DRumHy.gif). I'll be researching both methods to decide, and I'll give my husband a recap when he gets home later to see what he thinks.

Tubal Ligation &amp; Novasure happening Monday morning - parents going insane.,"You may have seen my post a few weeks back about my failed Essure procedure. Well we got the tubal ligation scheduled &amp; as an added bonus, Novasure! We are very excited &amp; I am thrilled to FINALLY get this stuff done &amp; over with - Monday morning at 5:30am

I took my stepmom(mom, really - my mom passed away and she stepped in to raise me) to dinner Thursday night to tell her in person. Of course she lost it. We have told her on multiple occasions we didn't want to have children &amp; the last time we spoke about it was on Memorial day at the lake - people had been drinking and tempers were running hot - I ended up in bed crying &amp; we never talked about it again.

But with my procedure scheduled, I knew I had to tell her once &amp; for all.  She keeps asking me to wait - like somehow in a year or two I'll change my mind....and asked me if my husband was forcing me to do this ?! (WTF seriously.) Just really wouldn't let it go. It's like she still thinks I'm 12 and this is some sort of rash decision I'm making - when really, my husband &amp; I talk about it ALL THE TIME - we went together to the doctors office - we are in agreement 110% - And I kept harping on that &amp; it's like she wouldn't listen to me - ""Oh but you'll change your mind!!!!"" - ""Then we can adopt."" ---but no answer was good enough. And here I am two days later - high as a kite on the couch because I just got my wisdom teeth taken out &amp; she calls me to talk about my choices again!?!?! Not to check on me - but to tell me not to do it.

I want to always be open with her because she was an amazing mom &amp; I wouldn't be half the person I am now if she hadn't stepped in. But this is making it so hard for me to be open. She won't respect my choice &amp; it's wearing me thin. I don't know how much longer I can be nice about it.

Anyone have a similar situation? How did you handle it?
Anyone have anything I can tell her that can maybe subdue her?
Ughhhhh it's driving me insane.

My apologies to the CF woman,"I have been lurking for over a year now, but I wish I would have found this subreddit before I ran into my first CF patient. I can't apologize to her in person, so this is the next best place.

I am an x-ray tech, and one of my responsibilities is to assist the radiologist with the hysterosalpingogram, which is an exam to determine whether or not the fallopian tubes are open in women that suffer from infertility. Day after day, I talked to these women that desperately want children but can not conceive. Then I met the CF woman. 

I brought the patient into my exam room and started my usual line of questioning with, ""So what brings you here today?"" She said that she needed this exam to be sure that her Essure was successful. Embarrassed at my ignorance, I asked what Essure was. She told me that it was a permanent form of sterilization that causes the fallopian tubes to close. My face froze, and I was shocked. I had never heard of Essure let alone sterilization before having children. 

I knew that some people don't have children, but I usually assumed it was because of infertility, not choice. Although I did not verbally bingo this woman, my facial expressions gave away my surprise, and she absolutely picked up on it. I could see her getting defensive, and I felt horrible. I didn’t mean to make her feel judged. I was just surprised that options for sterilization exist for people that don’t want children. The truth was that I was both jealous and curious. Jealous because this woman knew exactly what she wanted, and curious, because it might be the answer that I’ve been looking for myself.

The radiologist came into the room, and I explained the reason for the procedure. Without any judgmental comments or vibes, the radiologist completed the exam and congratulated her after confirming that the Essure was successful and that her tubes were closed. He was absolutely great with her, and I was ashamed of myself for not keeping control of my facial expressions. 

Looking back, I would have considered myself a fencesitter doomed to fall into the traditional life script, but after spending time here, I can confidently say that I’ll be forever free without children. You guys have said everything that I have felt towards children, and I have never related to a group of people as much as this one. So, to the CF woman, I’m so sorry that my confusion and ignorance came across as judgments, but thank you for being brave and confident with your decision, and thank you for my first glimpse at the CF lifestyle! I’ve moved to the dark side, guys! ;)

"Have you ever filed a complaint about an incompetent ob/gyn? I am, and need some ideas on how to best make my case. Probably can be taken as a rant against shitty doctor.","So I went to another ob/gyn (after I moved) and asked the clinic for a doctor that would be open to permanent bc options. They recommended one, who ended up being incompetent and disrespectful. 

So I'm filing a complaint. I'm not paying that asshole $50. 



I explained my medical history in detail. I have severe PMDD because my body does not react well to progesterone. Over the past 3 years I've been on 6 bc methods (pills plus shot) and changed every few months because of many unacceptable side effects. I told the doctor this. I bled for 8 months at one point because the pills fucked up the lining in the uterus (so it was fragile and as thin as a 90 year old according to the previous doctor. So every time I moved it broke off a little more). And now I've been bleeding all of March with no sign of it stopping now in April. 


The progesterone only pill and shot were the worst. Constant headaches, lethargy, exhaustion, my appetite completely disappeared etc. PMS/PMDD symptoms every day but on a less severe level as before. 

And the pattern continued. The more progesterone the worse it was for me. the first doctor I ever saw (before I moved) gave me Lupron for six months with estrogen replacement. He was simulating menopause and those six months were wonderful. I'd never felt so good since puberty. And no PMDD. 


I asked the doctor what permanent options there were. I couldn't get a hormone free IUD because of a metal allergy, and the mirena/other IUDs and the arm implant are progesterone only. 


He bingos me. Tries to play psychologist when that's not his job. If the clinic hadn't lied to me I wouldn't have seen him. 


I asked him can I at least have a high estrogen low progesterone pill?

And what does he do? He prescribes me a *HIGH progesterone pill*. And tells me ""I have other patients to see, I don't have anymore time.""


It's a combination of not listening to me about my health, taking away my bodily autonomy, being disrespectful and being an incompetent idiot who didn't seem to listen to a word of my medical history. 


The other reason I wanted to discuss permanent options (ideally removal of ovaries since that--and going into menopause with estrogen replacement--would cure me, plus I can't do essure because of the metal allergy). is because pills fuck with my lamictal for seizures. Lamictal doesn't effect bc but bc makes Lamictal less effective. So I have to be on a super high dose that should be considered too much for my low BMI/weight. So I get extra fun side effects from that. 


I complained to the clinic and am considering complaining to the ethics board here if they don't remove my bill etc. Has anyone filed a complaint? How did you  present your argument if you did?

I think my doctor is trying to convince me to get a long term IUD because he believes I'm going to change my mind,"Went to the doctor yesterday hoping to get essure. I'm only 20, so I was definitely expecting some push back and I got it. I heard the ""change your mind"" line a couple of times and he was really pushing for a copper IUD, instead of essure, which is what I said I wanted. My doctor said that essure and a copper IUD can both have a higher risk of complications for women who've never had a child since its harder to see what you're doing in there and everything is tighter I guess? But if the IUD would go wrong, then he could easily remove it and try something else. If essure were to go wrong, it would be very difficult to fix and could be life changing in a bad way with all the pain and cramping. He also said the IUD would last long term (up to 30 years) even though it's not advertised for that.

But he kept saying that, ""plus if you change your mind, you can just take it out!"" I can't tell if he is actually taking my opinions into account or just doing what he wants and doesn't actually believe I will need the IUD that long.

Childfree Friendly Essure Consult: Northern California!,"Location: Planned Parenthood, Seaside, Northern California. 

Ok this is my update about my Essure consult; it went PERFECTLY.

There was absolutely no bingoing. She asked me:

*Why are you here?* For an essure consult. 

*Do you know what essure is?* I explained to her that I had been researching being sterilized for half my life and that I am very informed

She did not ask:
If I had any children
If I wanted an IUD
If I wanted other BC instead
What if I find ""the right man""
etc etc etc 

I also explained to her (Without being asked) that I have been solid about this decision since I began talking and thinking and that I have always wanted this.

She asked me how old I was to find out if I was old enough to sign the consent form (which she showed me). You have to be 21 (says on the form) to sign it, which is fine. I will wait the couple of months til I am 21 vs go from gyno to gyno and get grilled.

She did not make me feel uncomfortable, and did not judge me for my decision. She said ""as long as you are sure this is what you want its fine"" and when I left ""see you in a couple of months!"" I made 100% certain that when I go in, I can 100% for sure get essure; she said yes.

At this location, they only turn you down if you had some kind of surgery (Im not sure what exactly since Ive never had a surgery I did not note this), or if you are unsure. 

It was just the dream consult for something like this. Make sure you present yourself well, and be able to show that you understand 100% what essure is. I had absolutely no problems (and had so much anxiety about this appointment, I thought I might vomit...)

This location is wonderful for essure, and for my 21st birthday, I will celebrate by filling my essure paperwork out :D I have never been so excited!!! This is my dream come true and I am just so happy! Now all I have to do is not die of a heart attack from excitement until then...

I’m 31 and I have to have a hysterectomy,"I’m child free so this isn’t horribly heart breaking for me, but it still blows my mind. 

In 2019, at 29, I had a bilateral salpingectomy(tube removal) and an uterine ablation to deal with my periods. I am not a candidate for hormonal birth control, and in 2016 I had Essure placed. It worked fine, but it started to cause pain after a little while so I opted for the tubal and ablation. 

An uterine ablation is where they shock/burn the endometrium to create scar tissue so you no longer have a period. It worked instantly. I was in Heaven! No more periods! 

That was in October of 2019, and last year, around September, I began having cyclical type pain. However, it was so dull I couldn’t tell if it was actually cyclical or if I was just constipated. I still mentioned it to my OBGYN, and he said he wanted to do an ultrasound just to be sure nothing was amiss. When I had my ultrasound about a month later—thanks, insurance—the pain had started again, so they were able to see what is happening every month. 

The ultrasound showed that I am bleeding behind my scar tissue, and the blood is trapped. It cannot get out. This causes my uterus to dilate and swell. The only fix is a hysterectomy. Thanks to insurance I haven’t been able to get one yet. 

Every month the pain gets worse, and the cycles last longer. I asked my OBGYN to prescribe me something for the pain, and they said, “we don’t prescribe pain medicine. Take 800mg of ibuprofen every 12 hours, as needed.”

This month I ended up in the ER three times in four days. The first hospital I was sent to by my GP, and they did nothing except give me toradol. They did no follow up imaging or any other testing. Just gave me toradol and sent me home. 

The next night the pain was unbearable. It was so bad I begged my husband to kill me. The only thing I could do at that point was ride out the pain until it ended—when the pain hits it will typically last for about five hours, have a two hour break, and then return. 

The next morning I went to a different hospital. At the second hospital they did some imaging, and gave me some medicine to calm me down and something for pain. Whatever they gave me knocked me out. When I woke up they were telling me I was good to go home. My husband brought me home, and around 10:30 that night I got a frantic phone call from the hospital I had been to. It was the radiologist’s secretary calling to tell me that I was in fact NOT okay to go home, and if I started to hurt again I MUST return. A few hours later we were on our way back to the hospital. 

I was admitted for two days while they tried to control my pain. If we didn’t stay out in front of the pain it was uncontrollable. They would give me toradol, Tylenol, percocet, and dilaudid. Nothing would kill it once it started. I would just writhe in the bed, and scream and cry until it ended. 

The doctor came to me and told me he was going to schedule a hysterectomy for the next day. Later that day the nurse came and told me they were planning it for that night instead. Later again, the doctor came in and told me he couldn’t get my insurance to approve the surgery. I would have to wait. He said he could perform it as an emergency, but then there was also no guarantee insurance would pay for that either. 

They ended up discharging me instead, with dilaudid to take home as well as the medication Orilissa to send me into early menopause to hopefully stop the bleeding. I am currently in limbo with the insurance company trying to get the surgery approved. 

I wanted to type all of this out to let everyone know of post ablation syndrome. Your endometrium tries to grow back, and you literally hemorrhage behind scar tissue and the blood is trapped. 

No one told me that 30% of people who have ablations end up with post ablation syndrome. It only took 2 years for my ablation to fail, and this is the worst pain I have ever been in. The OBGYN at the hospital told me people who have had children compare the pain to natural child birth.

I'm getting Sterilized!,"[Previous Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/4bz7w1/tubal_ligation_in_nashville_tennessee/)

I finally had my consultation two days ago. I talked with the Doctor and she shared that Tubal Ligations were pretty much phased out and that instead they remove the fallopian tubes all together. She asked if I had considered going with Essure (the metal coils in fallopian tubes) instead. I work Law Enforcement, so the down time with the Tubal would have been an issue with me.

I looked into Essure, and I think its the right route for me. I got the call back today letting me know my insurance would completely cover the cost of the procedure (minus the $25 copay).

So I have my appointment for the Pre-Op (where we will fully go over the procedure and I'll probably be given a pill to help with softening my cervix before the procedure) on the 19th. And on the 24th I'll get the Essure put in! (And I'll get the Depo Shot since it could take up to 3 months to really sterilize me.)

Just found out I can't get Essure,"So I finally got all my health insurance sorted (shitty USA barely affordable plan) and started looking into how to make sure Essure would be 100% covered since I can't handle hormonal bc anymore.

Personal comments for birth control?,"Hi, female birth control question. My husband and I want to look into a good birth control for me.

Essure and sterilization are off of the table right now, I'm not interested in anesthesia unless my life needs saving. 4 years ago I not only woke up during wisdom tooth removal (which thankfully I don't recall) I also stopped breathing. I'm not comfortable yet using that again. I'm wary of IUD's too. I get ovarian cysts time to time and while I don't have PCOS I've read that IUD's can make cysts worse, it depends on the person. Not too keen on finding out what sort of person I am.

I'm looking at Nexplanon/Implanon. I don't have to fully consider this until 1.5 years from now so I may switch, but these seem pretty convenient and out of the way and effective. I hate needles. But am interested and willing to have 1 minute of scary if this is worth it to keep 18 years of scary (depending on how abortion ratifications go) out of my life until I hit menopause.

"Upvotes for Dr. John J. Marks in Raleigh, NC.","I went in for an Essure consultation, as my IUD is due to come out in November.  Apparently he no longer does Essure because he watched two out out of three procedures fail and no longer feels comfortable performing them.  But long story short, I told him about my past painful experiences with IUDs (blacking out from the pain, vomiting all over the office, the whole nine yards)... and he suggested sending me to a separate facility and putting me under a twilight anesthesia during the IUD procedure.  This is the first OBGYN that I've had recommend such a thing.  He also offered to write me a prescription for some hard pain meds for any abdominal pain after the procedure.  So it looks like I'll be sticking with the IUDs.  

For those of you in North Carolina, I would highly recommend Dr. Marks.  He was completely non-judgemental about my reasons for wanting to remain on birth control long-term, and the fact that he was the first of many doctors to recommend some out-of-the-ordinary pain management shows that he truly cares for his patients.  I think I'll be coming to him as my regular gynecologist from now on.  He seems like such a sweet, gentle man.

"Not ""Fixed"", But Got Nexplanon Today","I've been trying to convince the VA's gyno to do a bilateral salpingectomy for a few years. Last year, we attempted essure (which didn't cooperate). Rather than keep me on the pill indefinitely, I got Nexplanon.

Essure in just a few hours!,"I'm so excited!

I feel incredibly lucky to have found a doctor that will permanently sterilize me at the age of 26 with no kids. Especially since I live in the Bible belt and my doctor works at a Catholic hospital. She told me that luckily, since her actual office isn't on hospital grounds, she can preform the procedure at her discretion. Convenient loopholes for the win!

The past couple of weeks have really dragged out while I've been waiting for this day. Even better, we will be scheduling my husband's vasectomy soon (can never be too careful).

Infertility and Sterilization,"I keep thinking about this.

After 7 years of searching I finally found a doctor who is willing to *talk* with me about permanent sterilization. For those interested, it's Dr. Thomas Harman in Morgantown, WV (West Virginia, I know, right)

I have posted here and on /r/endo about the severity of my disease. I have been diagnosed as ""almost definitely"" infertile by 3 physicians and 2 surgeons at this point in my life yet getting even ablation or essure has been impossible for me.

My question is why? Why am I denied these procedures? My uterus does not work. I don't want children but there's an extremely small chance that I could get pregnant and rather than worry about I am volitionally submitting for non-fecundity.

When I first found out I was likely sterile, honestly, I was relieved. It was the *only* good thing to come out of my physically debilitating endometriosis. I used to think sterilization would be easier for me because Im already sterile.

It's not. I see so many women and men here who, of course, struggle to get these procedures but get them non the less. At 25 Im just in the early talking stages of them. I had my first lapararoscopy when I was 20. I took Lupron depot, an extremely dangerous drug, when I was 17. I shattered 3 bones in my left foot by tripping because of this drug; my bone density was decimated. Yet I cannot get a procedure to definitively sterilize an already likely sterile person?

I hear all these people *pitying* me. The doctors have acted like because Im infertile that getting pregnant MUST be a huge concern for me and I've even had doctors laugh at me for asking about volitional non-fecundity.

Why is this? Why it this so screwed up?

"Nexplanon has stopped my periods, so how can I have my essure HSG at the right point in the cycle I don't have?","Pretty much what the title says. It's been three months since I had my coils placed, so I called to make my HSG appointment yesterday. The radiology nurse told me I had to schedule the test between the sixth and twelfth days of my cycle. I explained that I've had like four periods in the last two years and therefore couldn't even begin to guess what day of my lousy cycle I'm on, but she was having none of it.

 From reading up on the procedure, I'm thinking maybe she isn't 100% aware of the differences between a fertility HSG and an essure placement HSG, since she told me the main reason I had to have it done at this point in the cycle (God, I'm so sick of writing that word) is because the test will abort the baby if I do happen to be pregnant, to which I say, a) Good, flush the little bastard out before he takes hold, and b) So give me a goddam pregnancy test first.

So my questions to anyone who knows more than I do (which is just about anyone) are: is possible pregnancy the reason this procedure has to be scheduled this way? What happens if I call tomorrow and lie through my teeth, saying, Gosh, what luck, my period started today, I'll be ready to go next week? Will there be actual physical consequence, or will the worst of it be a radiologist who sort of suspects I'm lying but can't prove it? Should I call my OB/GYN's office and ask her advice/for her to talk some sense into the radiologist?

Sorry about all them words, and thanks for any insight anyone has!

My husband thinks I'm cold as ice on the kids issue and I still don't care.,"My Essure appointment is on December 9th. I am 100% on board and into it. Excited, even. 

My husband is being a fence-sitter despite being 100% on board before the wedding. I don't think he really even tookt he time to think about it. 

I told him what I told my doctor, when doctor asked how my husband felt: If he wants kids, I will wish him luck with someone else. 

I want to be with my husband forever. I really do. I also know that life happens and sometimes shit doesn't work out because two people may grow in different directions. 

I am stuck with myself forever. If I give birth to a child, whether I keep it, give it up for adoption, or decide to be an absentee mother, that is something that I have to live with forever, whether or not I am with my husband. 

My husband is 35 and is still unsure of what he will want in ten years. 

I am 25 and I know for sure that I do not want to be a mother. I don't want to parent. I don't want kids. I'd rather regret not having kids (unlikely) than regret having them. I surely don't want to be 35 and having kids with my 45 year old husband. It's not the life I want. Even if I had infinite resources and the world was guaranteed to give my child a good life, I still wouldn't want kids. I have 6 nieces and nephews on my side and 3 on my husbands side, ranging from 2 weeks old to 21 years old, with toddlers and teens in between. I love the shit out of them. I also love that they aren't my kids. 

The only people who seem to be 100% supportive are my neighbors (who have a planned 6 month old. They're awesome parents!) and my mother, who has 4 kids. My mother loves us but she has told me that if she could tell her 17 year old self to never have kids, she would. I don't take it personally. I know exactly what she means. 

My female friends, ranging from 24 to 30+, think I'm making a mistake. It's funny, because if they got pregnant and wanted to keep their babies, I'd think they all were making mistakes. But, is it my place to say so? No. Just because *you* are 30 and wishy-washy does not mean that I have the same feelings, and that is OK. 

So, in conclusion, if my husband decides he wants kids, he's going to have to choose between having kids and being with me. Cold hearted or realist?

My female friends, ranging from 24 to 30+, think I'm making a mistake. It's funny, because if they got pregnant and wanted to keep their babies, I'd think they all were making mistakes. But, is it my place to say so? No. Just because *you* are 30 and wishy-washy does not mean that I have the same feelings, and that is OK. 

So, in conclusion, if my husband decides he wants kids, he's going to have to choose between having kids and being with me. Cold hearted or realist?

Two months post-op hysterectomy,"Back in May I started my period and bled right up until they removed my uterus on July 21st. I've been child free since I can remember and was actually sterilized eight years ago via Essure. My hysterectomy wasn't for sterilization purposes, rather because I couldn't stop bleeding and no one knew why. My doctor did not fight me when I asked her to take it.

I just wanted to give an update on how I'm doing two months out. I feel completely healed. There's no more tenderness in my scars across my belly, there's no pain in my vagina or vulva. I have no trouble urinating or having bowel movements and most importantly NO MORE PERIODS.

 I really can't explain how much better I felt immediately after surgery. My pre surgery symptoms were so bad I didn't want to live anymore. I've gone back to work and my normal sex life with my husband has resumed. Sex feels the same as it did before (I never had painful sex).

"(SFW) Well, this happened at the gyno office.","BACKSTORY:  

When I got this job, the first thing I did with my fancy new health insurance was go see the gyno. I had not had insurance for about 13 years so I was super stoked and I was ready to get off the Pill and onto something more long term. My husband and I are not having kids (no, not ever) so I was looking into a tubal + ablation or Essure.

Long story short, the gyno was awesome about not having babies but admitted that her superiors required a lot of hoops to jump through for a patient in my situation who wanted permanent sterilization so we decided that the Mirena was the best option for me right now. Insurance covered it, it was easy to get and is just as effective as the permanent measures. I got the IUD a week later, it sucked for a day but otherwise not a big deal and we set up a time for me to come back in a month to check things out.

THE ACTUAL STORY:

At my one month checkup, I asked the receptionist if she knew if I'd be getting an ultrasound for the IUD. She did not know and asked me to tell her on my way out. 

I went in for the checkup, everything was fine and we did not do an ultrasound. On my way out, it had gotten a bit more crowded and the receptionist was helping someone else so I just waved and kept walking. She saw me and called out ""Did you get the ultrasound?"" and I replied ""No, not today"" and she then said ""Oh well, maybe next time!"" and we said bye and I left. 

I was waiting for the elevator with about 3-5 other people and a woman who had left right behind me walks up, places one hand on my shoulder and stands on the other side, effectively trapping me while she puts her other hand on my lower abdomen and coos ""Oh poor baby, they'll take your picture next time!"".  I was frozen in shock at first but regained my senses enough to say (in a level-but-horrified voice) ""I'm not pregnant, I just got an IUD placed.""

Pause.

Recoil.

Withdraw.

*She didn't even apologize, she just froze, stepped away and didn't look at me.*  I followed her into the elevator and she stood as far away as she could.

Approved for Essure! (warning: long),"So, I noticed that in the last couple of weeks there were some Essure rejection stories. I recently was approved, so I figured I'd share my experience. As you can see in my flair, I'm 32, and I live in Texas.

I haven't wanted children for a long time. Possibly ever. When I was younger, I just thought it was something I eventually had to do. Well, I decided to go to college (graduated 10 years ago this Friday - man, I feel old). When the right man for the job hadn't made an appearance, I started a career. The longer I worked, the more I realized that children wouldn't add anything to my lifestyle and that I couldn't think of any reason I might want a child. Of course, I've been told that I'd change my mind (&amp; then as I aged, that I ""still had some time left""), so I didn't do anything permanent.

At the beginning of the year, my insurance plan was renewed, which means that sterilization is now covered. I figured it was time. I scheduled my appointment with a new doctor (previous one did not do the Essure procedure), and I did state that I was interested in getting Essure.

When I went in for my consultation, I was told that my doctor was busy with another appointment that had run over, so in the meantime, another doctor did my exam (I was up for my regular well-woman). After that stuff was done, she asked if I had questions about other BC options. I told her that I'd tried different three types of pills and that I'd had a variety of unpleasant side effects with each. I did go into detail about the side effects with each pill. I did also tell her I'd looked into IUDs, but since I hadn't enjoyed hormonal BC, that I wasn't interested in Mirena, and I wasn't interested in the longer, more painful periods that come with Paragard, since mine already are pretty unpleasant. Besides, if I did get Paragard, which is good for 10-12 years, I'd have to deal with awful periods for the entire time only to have it taken out around age 42-44, which would almost certainly be the end of my fertility anyway. So I told her that it was more practical for me to get it done now instead of suffering for 10-12 years to have achieved the same result.

And then she went into the whole ""well, I don't know if the doctor will do it, since you've never had children"" thing. I'm sure you can all feel my dread. I told her that I wasn't interested in any other BC if that was going to be the case, that my bf and I would just stick to condoms. I told her that I really didn't want children, but I wasn't going to deal with awful side effects until the end of my fertility. I also mentioned that I'd used Plan B twice, which is true, but I'd rather not have to rely on it, if condoms fail. She also asked about my relationship - we've known each other for 2 years, but I'm not going to ask my boyfriend to get a vasectomy when I want to make the choice for myself. He is supportive though; he was excited for me when I told him I was going to this consult.

She again expressed her hesitation but advised it was ultimately up to the doctor to decide whether or not she would do the procedure. Since the doctor still wasn't done with her previous appointment, she asked again if I had any questions about IUDs. I got a bit exasperated at that point. I'm 32 for crying out loud. Whoops, turns she's 32 also &amp; still is at the ""maybe, someday"" mindset. No wonder she's so hesitant with me. Hooray for personal bias.

Since the exam was done, I was sent to the waiting room to wait for my doctor to be available. Then the other gal came back to tell me that the doctor was in a tight schedule &amp; couldn't speak with me directly, but she approved me! I was overjoyed! They sent me along to get my depo shot to thin my uterine lining. Let me tell you, that was a bitch. My side was sore for about a week after the shot. But hey, it's just this once, I can manage.

I'm scheduled for the Friday before Memorial Day. My office is closed that Monday, so I get a 3-day weekend to recover. They advised me that I need to pick up some prescriptions the day before, and that I'll need someone to drive me to/from the appointment, due to the meds. If anyone has any tips for me, feel free to share. And if anyone is able to use any of the info above to get their sterilization approved, I'm happy to have shared this.

Got my Essure yesterday!  AMA!  Story inside.  (x-post from r/childfree),"Hi, everyone! I finally got my Essure today! It was a completely painless experience. Because of the Affordable Care Act, every single aspect of it was 100% covered by my insurance. Here is the scoop for interested parties from top to bottom:

I wasn't allowed to eat anything after midnight, nor drink any water after 5 AM. I showed up at the doctor's office and filled out some general paperwork. I was completely starving, so I was really excited to be put under so that I wouldn't be hungry anymore. I managed to ignore it as much as possible as I waited, and then I was finally called back from the waiting room, where I filled out some more paperwork and answered some medical and insurance questions. I was then taken back to give a urine sample for a pregnancy test.

Once it was confirmed negative, they took a couple of vitals and then fitted with an IV. I waited for a few moments, and the anesthesiologist showed up. She gave me a cocktail of Fentanyl and Versed - one drug for the pain, and the other to block the formation of new memories. Therefore, I began to feel a little fuzzy, and then I felt a wave of happiness wash over me, and I couldn't control myself from giggling. My boyfriend asked me, ""So that's quite funny to you, is it?"" and I nodded.

Then, what felt like three or four seconds later, I had a cup of ice chips and a spoon in my hand, and an ice pack on my stomach. I asked what the ice pack was for, and I was told that the procedure was all finished. I took a few more minutes, maybe 15-20, to 'come out' of my druggedness and eat ice chips. Then I had to go and pee to let everyone know that everything still worked properly, and then I got dressed and got wheeled out to my best friend's car.

We went and had burgers and ice cream, and then I got my prescription for Vicodin filled, but I honestly haven't needed it. After the initial drugs wore off, I felt a bit of dull, light cramping in the abdomen - not unlike some of the more mild menstrual cramps I've had in the past. I was also told that I might be nauseated, but I haven't had any problems with that, either.

I have a two week follow up appointment, and I've been told not to have sex or use tampons until that time. That is going to suck. But everything went off without a hitch! A perfectly painless procedure. If anyone has any other questions, I'd love to answer them!",TwoXChromosomes,2013-03-23 14:52:29,hi everyone finally got today completely painless experience affordable care act every single aspect covered insurance scoop interested party top bottom allowed eat anything midnight drink water showed doctor office filled general paperwork completely starving really excited put hungry anymore managed ignore much possible waited finally called back waiting room filled paperwork answered medical insurance question taken back give urine sample pregnancy test confirmed negative took couple vitals fitted iv waited moment anesthesiologist showed gave cocktail fentanyl versed one drug pain block formation new memory therefore began feel little fuzzy felt wave happiness wash control giggling boyfriend asked funny nodded felt like three four second later cup ice chip spoon hand ice pack stomach asked ice pack told procedure finished took minute maybe druggedness eat ice chip pee let everyone know everything still worked properly got dressed got wheeled best friend car went burger ice cream got prescription vicodin filled honestly needed initial drug wore felt bit dull light cramping abdomen unlike mild menstrual cramp past also told might nauseated problem either two week follow appointment told sex use tampon time going suck everything went without hitch perfectly painless procedure anyone question love answer,got yesterday ama story inside,"Got my Essure yesterday!

1.	I know none of you can technically diagnose anything on the internet.
2.	I’m proactively working with several different specialists (see below) and have been unable to figure this stuff out. 
3.	I’m only looking for new ideas/possibilities to take to them to discuss, which they are all open to at this point.
4.	I do have most test results and reports and some pictures (rashes), or can get them fairly quickly if requested. Just ask for what you need. I’ve been working on figuring out what’s going on starting in 2001, and have tons, so I’m not going to post it all. Let me know what you want/need to see. I’m not sure what results and tests you might want to have-from which doctors/time periods, etc.
5.	Open to all questions and suggestions!


Now, that being said… please help if you can!!!

My PRIMARY CONCERN is that there is something systemic that they are missing that might be causing multiple issues. I’m having skin, digestive, and pain issues listed  below that they can’t find a cause for and that are not responding to conventional, and some unconventional, treatments. 

**44/F/5’8”/170lbs/25.8 BMI/white/Ohio** (symptoms started in Japan and Tennessee)

Military veteran (shipboard Navy 5 years –OEF Combat)
Smoker 2pk/day ~30 yrs

**Currently diagnosed with:**

Mental Health: Borderline Personality Disorder, Bipolar Disorder, PTSD

Neurology: Seizures, Migraine, Vasovagal Syncope*, Tremor,  Sleep apnea*

GI: IBS*, Colonic Inertia* &amp; Polyps, Recurring SIBO*, Gastroparesis*, GERD

Dermatology: Psoriasis*, eczema*, contact dermatitis*, UKN Systemic/dietary Allergy

Other: Fibromyalgia*, High Cholesterol* &amp; Triglycerides, Vit D deficiency*, Low blood pressure*, TMJ disorder, pelvic pain*, tinnitus and hearing loss, general edema (mostly legs, hands and face)


****The VA is required to label something with a diagnosis in order to do certain tests or to prescribe any type of medication or treatment for certain symptoms. So, even though they don’t know what is causing the above things or what they are, they’ve “diagnosed” these things as close as they can as noted above.****

**UNDIAGNOSED/UNRESPONSIVE TO TREATMENT**: 

-***Rash/s*** (Started about 10 years ago in the navy. Has changed over time. The current presentation started about 1.5 yrs ago. Level 10 painful almost constant when flared, sharp intense itch on outer labia, front rt shoulder, back of rt ear, and back of lft neck, lasts for at least several weeks at a time)-done patch testing, exclusion diets, tried script ointments, creams, shampoos, excluding chemicals, wear only cotton, use cotton fabric fem products, etc, no relief. Current derm is a new one and is a researcher, so hopeful. Have pictures of most recent flare up.  [NSFW Link to rash photos WARNING Close up of hairy rashy lady part.](http://imgur.com/a/oDxJ1)

***-pelvic pain*** (Started dealing with this around 2004. Got Mirena IUD, then Essure. Had Essure put in one side and other side tube removed in 2005. In 2014, the Essure side tube was engorged and infected and was removed along with part of the Essure device. Part of the device remains. Level 9-10 pain wakes me up at night, intermittent, several trips to the ER. Have had 2 hemorrhaging cysts. Three ER and other Dr visits with no indication of what the pain is. Sudden 10 pain sharp specific to the same spot pain in low left pelvic region)-Tests show nothing (ultra sound, xray, CT), currently have Mirena IUD 1yr and Lupron Depot 3months. Almost immediate relief after starting Lupron. I want hysterectomy, Gyn wants me to do on/off Lupron until menopause. 

***-gastric symptoms*** (Overall started around 2001 with IBS symptoms. Has evolved and escalated to current symptoms including gastroparesis and colonic inertia along with the bloating and following pain symptoms: 6-7 pain dull pressure type usually generalized to the left side, extreme bloating, constipation)-Can literally go several weeks without bowel movement or urge to go. Have done biofeedback and tests for the lack of urge issue. Those mechanics seem to be working. By the sitz marker and other testing, it seems to just sit in the transcending and mostly the descending colon hanging out. It doesn’t seem to make any difference as to how much fiber I eat, water I drink, or even if I take copious amounts of Miralax or similar daily. Basically, unless I take enough to turn everything to straight liquid I can’t induce a bowel movement.  Even then, I can take 10-12 doses at once (instructions from GI Dr), and it can still take a couple days for it to act! The pain part doesn’t necessarily come from the constipation. It happens pretty much any time. Doesn’t seem to be associated with any particular food, activity, or in relation to how long it’s been since my last BM. Oh, and my BMs aren’t usually hard or anything, actually they’re usually quite soft. So, we can’t figure out what the hold up is or why the intense pain and bloating.

***-generalized all over body 5-6 pain***/stiffness especially in knee and hip joints since 2009 increased in the last 2-3 years. Tenderness pressing knee, spine, neck, and shoulder joints. My skin hurts a lot-don’t know how else to say that. It’s like I’m acutely aware of where my skin is touching anything-my leg against the chair, my arm against my shirt, my hand against my glove, etc. I do yoga or walk when I feel up to it, but pretty much any physical activity more than that makes it worse later-even just housekeeping or grocery shopping. It sucks especially since I used to be very athletic (marathon, camping, hiking, etc). I’ve tried several different pain medications (like Lyrica and Cymbalta) but they made no difference. Trying acupuncture and Meloxicam now. Not sure either is really doing much, but just started them. I do use a couple different meditation techniques that work pretty well sometimes. I’m not willing to try Tramadol or narcotics due to a past drug abuse history. 

***-Specific 2 pain in scaphoid area at base of thumb*** shoots to 7 on certain movements (no injury)-Have no idea what happened. Just started hurting when I tried to open my door last spring. Doing some exercises and stretches with the Occ Therapist using putty. Just started, so no results, yet. Negative for dquorvanes?sp but the motions that aggravate it indicate that type of injury/disease. Also tried a brace, but actually made it worse.

***-general fatigue***-think this ties in with the pain stuff (same time frame)? I am tired no matter how much or how well I sleep (I monitor my sleep due to the apnea) If I’m not keeping myself busy, I’ll fall asleep more often than not.

***-fainting? w/o loss of consciousness***- Not sure when it actually started, really noticed it a few years ago…thought it was just funny because it usually happens when I laugh really hard! But, now happens more frequently and with less intense trigger. When I suddenly laugh hard or get spooked-sudden being the key-I just fall/collapse. I can see, hear, etc. I just lose muscle control and fall down. It’s usually when I’m standing up, it’s only happened a couple times sitting in a chair.

***-high Cholesterol*** l remember my PC telling me I had HC probably 20plus years ago, trying a low fat diet and statins to no avail. My last draw was in December* 328Total/42HDL/253LDL/137TR*-This is with a low fat/almost vegetarian diet AND taking rosuvastatin. Mother has always had high cholesterol. Have no idea on this one. Dr made referral to endocrinologist for this one. Had blood drawn, but have not seen them yet.

***-low blood pressure*** Found this out last year while in patient in April 2015. Avg 106/74 when taking midodrine, smoking 2-3 packs of cig a day, and drinking up to 2 pots of black coffee. I can’t imagine how low it would be without the coffee/cig!! Without the meds &amp; cigs, it’s been as low as 79/54 (taken while sleeping as inpatient) There has been no investigation as to what is causing it at all. Just the notice that it’s consistently low and the prescription for midodrine. Done.


**Surgery/injuries:** Head trauma 1976 (car accident) &amp; 2001 (shipboard), Vagal Nerve Stimulator implant 2013 (for seizure), Tubes removed 1-2005 (deformed) 1-2015(infected), Bunionectomy 2004, PRK 2016, Kidney stone 1993, TMJ 1993,  several laparoscopic/endoscopic exploratory procedures between 2002-2014 to try to find out what’s going on in abdomen and pelvic areas.
**
Current meds/treatment/devices:** 
Cabamazepine (BoPD/BiPD/Seizure), Dicyclomine (GI), Hydroxyzine (Anxiety/PRN), Meloxicam (Pain), Midodrine (Low BP), Ondansetron (GI), Pantoprazole (GI), Cetirizine (Rash), Sumatriptan (Migraine PRN), Lupron Depot (Pelvic pain), Clobetesol (rash), Sprix (migraine PRN), Benedryl (Allergy PRN), Vitamin D (3,000IU/day), Meletonin (sleep PRN), Ranitidine (GI PRN), Topamax (Migraine/Seizure), rosuvastatin, CPAP, VNS Therapy Implant, Miralax (GI PRN), Mirana IUD (local hormone regulation), Mouth guard, Vegan/gluten free/low FODMAP Nickel Fat diet (trial for GI, cholesterol, &amp; rash), acupuncture in my ears every 6 weeks (pain)

**Current specialists** (they don’t really work as a “team”: Veterans Affairs-Primary Care, Endocrinology, Physical &amp; occupational therapy, Orthopedics, Acupuncture, Psychiatry, Gastroenterology, Audiology, Cardiology, and Dermatology. Private physicians for Gynecology and Neurology.

**Tests done:**
Upper/lower GI, Emptying studies, 2 different types of sitz marker, barium, endocrine studies, tons of blood work, patch testing, biopsy, several different cardiology, sleep studies, EEG, ECG, EKG, nerve studies, x-ray, CT, hearing, tilt table, halter monitor, ultra sound (heart, legs, pelvic, and abdominal)
  
**Test results in a nut shell:**
All (that I recall) were with in normal limits except the following…. Emptying studies showed delayed emptying, sitz markers were fully present at 5 days in all tests, biopsy showed abnormal cells but nothing specific, I forget what hearing showed but I have hearing aides now, sleep studies showed apnea, and every time (6 I think) showed positive for SIBO over the last 4 years, Pretty consistent lymphocytes and WBC high, Last Cholesterol in Dec was

My last draw was in December* 328Total/42HDL/253LDL/137TR*-This is with a low fat/almost vegetarian diet AND taking rosuvastatin. Mother has always had high cholesterol. Have no idea on this one. Dr made referral to endocrinologist for this one. Had blood drawn, but have not seen them yet.

***-low blood pressure*** Found this out last year while in patient in April 2015. Avg 106/74 when taking midodrine, smoking 2-3 packs of cig a day, and drinking up to 2 pots of black coffee. I can’t imagine how low it would be without the coffee/cig!! Without the meds &amp; cigs, it’s been as low as 79/54 (taken while sleeping as inpatient) There has been no investigation as to what is causing it at all. Just the notice that it’s consistently low and the prescription for midodrine. Done.


**Surgery/injuries:** Head trauma 1976 (car accident) &amp; 2001 (shipboard), Vagal Nerve Stimulator implant 2013 (for seizure), Tubes removed 1-2005 (deformed) 1-2015(infected), Bunionectomy 2004, PRK 2016, Kidney stone 1993, TMJ 1993,  several laparoscopic/endoscopic exploratory procedures between 2002-2014 to try to find out what’s going on in abdomen and pelvic areas.
**
Current meds/treatment/devices:** 
Cabamazepine (BoPD/BiPD/Seizure), Dicyclomine (GI), Hydroxyzine (Anxiety/PRN), Meloxicam (Pain), Midodrine (Low BP), Ondansetron (GI), Pantoprazole (GI), Cetirizine (Rash), Sumatriptan (Migraine PRN), Lupron Depot (Pelvic pain), Clobetesol (rash), Sprix (migraine PRN), Benedryl (Allergy PRN), Vitamin D (3,000IU/day), Meletonin (sleep PRN), Ranitidine (GI PRN), Topamax (Migraine/Seizure), rosuvastatin, CPAP, VNS Therapy Implant, Miralax (GI PRN), Mirana IUD (local hormone regulation), Mouth guard, Vegan/gluten free/low FODMAP Nickel Fat diet (trial for GI, cholesterol, &amp; rash), acupuncture in my ears every 6 weeks (pain)

**Current specialists** (they don’t really work as a “team”: Veterans Affairs-Primary Care, Endocrinology, Physical &amp; occupational therapy, Orthopedics, Acupuncture, Psychiatry, Gastroenterology, Audiology, Cardiology, and Dermatology. Private physicians for Gynecology and Neurology.

**Tests done:**
Upper/lower GI, Emptying studies, 2 different types of sitz marker, barium, endocrine studies, tons of blood work, patch testing, biopsy, several different cardiology, sleep studies, EEG, ECG, EKG, nerve studies, x-ray, CT, hearing, tilt table, halter monitor, ultra sound (heart, legs, pelvic, and abdominal)
  
**Test results in a nut shell:**
All (that I recall) were with in normal limits except the following…. Emptying studies showed delayed emptying, sitz markers were fully present at 5 days in all tests, biopsy showed abnormal cells but nothing specific, I forget what hearing showed but I have hearing

"IUD Questions... Contemplating the idea, but a little nervous! (Skyla in Canada?)","I've been reading this subforum for the last couple days, and I've learned a little bit about IUD's as a long-term form of birth control... 

Some background: I'm 23, 5'7"", 190lbs, sexually active, and never had kids. And I never want kids. I am currently on Alesse, which while has lightened my period lovely, I have a hard time being able to take it at the exact same time everyday. I generally only get to take it at SOME point, between 7-10pm. In 3 years of taking it, I've forgotten pills approximately 10x. 

I've read that Skyla is better(or at least more recommended) for women who have not had kids yet, and it's a little smaller than the other IUD's. I would go for this one, but I'm wondering if it's available in Canada? (And how would I find out if it is covered by my Health Insurance?) 

I saw somewhere someone mentioned that Skyla has a piece of silver on it. Does this contain nickel? I am allergic to nickel. Would Skyla be a higher hormone dose than Alesse, or smaller? 

Some Generic IUD things I was worried about, was the procedure of putting it in and how do they get it out? 

Also, the strings thing freaks me out. Does it effect wearing Tampons? Could a tampon snag the string and rip it out? Some people say it ends up tucked behind the cervix, what does that mean? Is it common for a man to be able to feel it? 

Would you go to a family doctor for this, or go straight to a gynocologist? Or Planned Parenthood, if available? 

I work in a very physical job(I groom dogs), so I am often lifting things, being dragged, running, bending, etc, would the IUD effect this? I see cramps mentioned a lot after insertion. Does it linger or effect exercise? If I wanted to start going to a gym, would I feel it? 

I feel like I am missing some of the questions I thought of, but I can't remember them right now. If I think of others, I'll add. :)

"I'm considering Essure, but also hate having my period?","I'm on a cocktail of medications, and the combination of Lexapro and Alesse causes my sex drive to be totally non-existent.

I'm 25, and have been sure that I don't want kids since the age of 7, so I'm considering the harrowing attempt at getting permanently sterilized.

But, I also benefit from skipping my period while on the pill. I have absolutely debilitating cramps, and get so upset from having my period I would do anything not to have them.

Is there some kind of happy medium? I've tried the depro shot, the patch and neither are good fits for me. I'm not sure an IUD would be good for me, since I rely on a DivaCup.

"14 days after our wedding, my husband followed through with his vasectomy!","I got the Essure method of sterilization done this past December, before we were engaged. We got engaged in March and married on Bastille Day, had a fantastic honeymoon, which had minimal child annoyances along the way, and now we're home and he followed through with his promise to me that he'd get snipped!
He wanted it for himself anyway to reflect his anti-humanity views, but also because I have a higher than average risk of ectopic pregnancy with the Essure, so he doesn't want to risk hurting/potentially killing me. What a keeper.

Our family is complete, with 3 cats, a snake, and 4 aquariums. Only some of my mom's friends commented on her wedding post if ""we'll hear pitter patters of small feet soon"", which my mom and brother quickly shut down with a ""only if it has 4 legs"" comment. 

I've been taking care of him all weekend, which is both comical and pitiful, passing the frozen peas back and forth to the freezer, making sure he has enough snacks and water while he plays video games.

"Tubal ligation and Essure experiences, please?","I'm positive this has been asked before, but I haven't seen anything lately. I have always know I didn't want children and never would, I know a child would ruin my life and who I am. So, I've started seriously considering a more permanent birth control and right now my favorites are laparoscopy and Essure, although I have reservations about both.

The laparoscopy seems to me very reliable and the down time not too bad. My biggest worry with this is the surgical portion. I have some dental anxiety and I've had a few oral surgeries in the past including a rather traumatizing immediate replacement of an implant and then a complete replacement a year later that have left me with some reservations about surgery in general even with anesthesia being involved. Because of this I am very hesitant to choose a surgical option, I didn't even really consider ligation until I found out about Essure and looked more into everything. 

I'm also very worried about the scarring from the surgery. I struggled with some self-harm issues for quite a few years and unfortunately I have some scars and I would am much as possible like to avoid adding any others. If anyone has advice on minimizing surgery scars (the can be nasty from what I've seen) I'd appreciate it.

Essure appeals to me very much because of the non-surgical aspect, obviously. But my worry, as is many others' with Essure, is the problems associated with it, unknown nickel allergies, etc. I think I read somewhere it only had a 75% success rate? Although, I'm not so sure I believe that. I'm not finding very much relieble information, which is also a negative factor. If anyone knows where I can find statistics, reports, studies, actual research on Essure and not just news please let me know. I've seen a lot of news articles, but I've studied and interned in journalism and I know sometimes you hand pick the numbers you want to make a more interesting story.

All-in-all, I'd just like experiences on healing, scarring, how you or someone else made a decision and facts. I'm very anxious about making deciding which route to take with permanent birth control, despite having a few years until I can decide. I just want to make the right decision for me.

"Had my Essure consultation today, this is how it went:","I'm 24 years old. I called a couple months ago to schedule a consultation with a doctor I'd found on the Essure website. I was nervous because when the nurse on the phone was asking me questions, she asked my age and if I was married and had any kids. ""No"" on both accounts. She immediately began in with, ""Oh, I don't think the doctor will perform this on you, then"" I interrupted with a quick, ""I have genetic issues and disorders that I believe make my case a little different"". She'd gone to ask the doctor about it, came back and said ""he will *consider* speaking with you"". We scheduled an appointment for November 21. About a week before the appointment, I get a call from them that they need to reschedule me. I was immediately disappointed and slightly annoyed because I felt that perhaps they had noticed the notes on my appointment scheduling and thought they could discourage me. I rescheduled regardless of my annoyance. Today was the appointment. I was nervous the entire ride there (about 1.5 hours away drive), but felt really determined. I'd typed out and printed a list of the myriad reasons why I did not want children and why I thought that I should be approved. I rehearsed it all with my boyfriend, him coming up with potential ""trick questions"" they might possibly throw at me. I arrived, filled out the paperwork and was called back to the doctor's office. It was a massive office, lots of airplane and WWII memorabilia all over. I stammered out why I was there, tried explaining my fear of hormonal BC with him (""I think you are highly misinformed about hormonal birth control, I don't know where you get this information""). I explained to him about my older sister's children, 1 died of SIDS and her youngest with very severe autism. Then I just followed up with, ""I just plain don't want kids, they're not for me and I've felt this way ever since I was a child"". He said, ""Your not wanting children is good enough for me. I've performed this procedure on women younger than you. I will do the Essure for you"". I was ECSTATIC. I got my annual gyno physical out of the way, a pap smear and pregnancy test. Everything turned out great.  Unfortunately, my insurance requires a 30-day waiting period (which is common) and since I'd JUST gotten done with my last period and my next will occur before the 30 day period is up, I have to wait until February to schedule the procedure (essentially, the *day* I get my period in February, I give him a call).

Tubal vs essure,"So I am so stoked, I had my annual with my on/gyn and I had pushed for this appointment so I can talk to him about getting tubal since my husband and I had a discussion and agreed that we we're ok with no kids. I've always been CF, not sure if my husband really was but he always agreed saying we would not have kids. We discussed in length and he said he was basically on the fence and no say one sway or another and I said I was totally against it but willing to discuss if he really wanted kids. He said he didn't. 

Anyway doctor asked me when we were planning on having kids and I said ""never"" and he said ""like never never?"" And I told him my husband say down and decided we were not and so he asked if I considered any procedures and I told him that's why I was pushing for this appointment. I told him I was leaning towards tubal and he said that from his experience, there were less complications from essure but the final decision was mine. I've read a lot on the 2 and am hoping to now get input from those that have had 1 or the other before I make my appointment for either or.

The science of sterilisation regret: a review you might like,"I hope I flared this one correctly.

In preparation for (yet another) GYN meeting tomorrow I have put my postgrad mind to use and combed through the latest scientific papers on post-sterilization regret.

I thought you might appreciate what I found:

&amp;#x200B;

The most often cited reasons for denying women sterilisation is indeed regret (Lalonde, 2018), but regret is not properly defined scientifically, and a systematic review by Curtis et al. (2006) discovered that because of the missing scientific clarity on what regret is or how it is measured, most studies on post-sterilisation regret in women define the term wildly different and uses significantly different ways to approximate it. Various studies on regret also conclude that generally “regret \[…\] is a rare event” and do not recommend to deny women the procedure but merely to properly inform them of the irreversible nature of it (e.g. Becner et al., 2015; Legendre et al., 2014).

&amp;#x200B;

Denial of the procedure due to the possibility of future regret is also “unique to women’s voluntary sterilisation” as it is not used at all or in the same gravity to scrutinize men’s decisions to undergo sterilization or the decision of women to undergo fertility treatment (Lalonde, 2018). It should also be noted that none of the studies in question make any comparison (a) to whether women who have been denied sterilisation actually changed their mind on the issue, or (b) to the percentage of regret in women who chose to have children. The latter – regret of motherhood – to this day is considered an extremely sensitive and taboo topic, also evident by the next to non-existent scientific research on it. However, any consideration of denying women voluntary sterilisation on the basis of regret must take into account the potential regrets that would arise from the alternative, i.e., motherhood, and women speaking out about regretting motherhood are rising exponentially (Lalonde, 2018; Curtis et al., 2006; see also Kingston, 2018; Mackenzie, 2018; Yasa, 2017 and many others).

&amp;#x200B;

As for the studies that report on regret, many are in agreement that regret of voluntary sterilisation is higher in younger women (e.g. Marcil-Gratton, 1988; Thranov et al., 1988; Jamieson et al., 2002). However, a lot of papers who cite post-sterilisation regret in women under 30 to be very high (&gt; 20%) without giving further context mostly refer to one specific study from 1999, called the CREST study (Hillis et al., 1999).

The results from this study suggested that for women aged 30 or under the “cumulative probability of expressing regret during a follow-up interview within 14 years” after sterilization was indeed 20.3%, compared to 5.9% for women over age 30 at the time of sterilization.

Unfortunately, subsequent review papers such as Curtis et al. (2006) use this as a basis for a blanket statement about high post-sterilization regret in women under 30. By doing so they omit the significantly lower reported regret in nulliparous women under 30: those without children have regret rates of 5%, equivalent to those women above 30 (mothers or not). Many other studies on post-sterilization regret also lump together nulliparous women with everybody else, thus skewing the results on their behalf.

&amp;#x200B;

In conclusion:

(a)  ‘Regret’ has no universal scientific definition and can hardly be measured;

(b)  Denial of female sterilization on the basis of regret is grossly negligent towards the potential regret of motherhood;

(c)  Many studies on post-sterilization regret do not recommend denial of the procedure, but simply to inform the patient of the irreversible nature of it;

(d)  Reviews of regret studies often omit the fact that reported post-sterilization regret in nulliparous women is lowest overall and equally low for women below 30 years of age and over.

&amp;#x200B;

I rest my case.

Appointment moved,"Guys, I need to vent.  I'm so pissed off right now.  

Back in February I had the Essure coils placed and then you have to wait 3 months for them to check to make sure the tissue has formed and is blocking the tubes.  The day of my appointment, after I got home and was just hanging around I called to schedule the appointment for my confirmation test.  

Today was my appointment, 5 minutes before I'm about to leave work I get a phone call from the Doctor's office saying the test can't be done in the office, it has to be done in the hospital and asked if the 19th worked.  

Not only has this appointment been on their calendar for 3 months and they could have caught that any other day that who ever scheduled it did it wrong, but they call me THE DAY OFF MY APPOINTMENT to tell me nope, don't come it.  She refused to say sorry for someone messing up, she refused to put any blame on the office at all.  Instead she blamed me.

I'm sorry I don't know the technical term for the fucking procedure.  

I just want to know if I'm sterile or not.  Now I have to wait a week and a day longer...

And I know it sucks, a lot of people can't even get done what I had done and I'm bitching about needing to wait another week and a day but I'm so angry right now.  Not so much that I have to wait a week and a day but that they call me just 2 hours before my appointment to tell me I messed up and they need to change the date.

do I just need another kind of doctor? Any ideas?,"I've had it with ob/gyns. I'm tired of their incompetence



For example: after agreeing with my observation that high progesterone or only progesterone pills/methods are worse for me, based on medical history and being switched brands/methods an average of every seven months, the latest doctor prescribed me a high progesterone pill and ran out so ""he'd have time for other patients""



Another ob/gyn put me on a new pill that he said was exactly like a pill I'd taken previously and which had the same side effects as all the others...and surprise surprise this one was just as bad. 


Another one laughed at my concern for bleeding for 8 months (by the time I saw her) and just kept repeating ""we'll check your bloodwork"" even though my general doctor *JUST* did that and my iron levels were fine (thanks to super healthy eating especially tons of tomatoes and veggies). She said in a really bitchy way ""If you *reeeeaaaaallly* want to, we'll check your bloodwork every week..."" 



Another told me in a really bitchy way ""that's not for you"" when she saw me looking at the essure brochure in her office. 


I'm sick and tired of this crap. Those are only a few gems here. 
But my issue is not only childfree and wanting a permanent solution for that:



But I have hormone issues that cause severe PMDD with a multitude of physical, emotional, and mental issues during that time, that has caused a pretty big negative impact on my life. When I tried birth control pills and the shot, the PMDD lessened a bit in severity but the symptoms became continuous and bleeding was constant on every goddamn pill. 


I did manage an appointment for an Essure consultation quite easily (even though I'm only 22) with my local planned parenthood that has an MD that's an expert there. But I'm really doubting that will do much help except give me the permanent birth control. I'd still have the PMDD and be suffering, but it wouldn't be every single day of the month (just roughly nearly half the month instead). 

Based on the patterns plus what the original ob/gyn said--of course he refused to fucking treat me because ""all womyns wants bay-beeeees!!!!""--and tons of research (real research like journal articles, etc. not webmd) my best bet would be ovary removal with possible replacement hormones for estrogen and testosterone (not progesterone). 




I can't afford to doctor shop anymore--time or money. I also don't have the time off work for ovary removal surgery yet, but at least I can try actual temporary solutions and get the process going for when I possibly can get the time off. 



Help? Ideas? Thanks?

I went in today to speak with a gyno specifically about my options to become sterile, and the doctor was very understanding, didn't bingo me once. I had dialogue ready, did my homework (going with a tubal over essure) and was ready to stand my ground, only for her to look at me and go ""Yeah, that's what I do! Let me set you up with our scheduler and we'll mark you down!"" I'm sure the fact that I'm over thirty helped of course, but she didn't even question me when I said I didn't have any kids.  


It feels like a weight has begun to lift off my shoulders. I don't think there's anything more empowering than taking control over your own body and future in the same act. I genuinely wish everyone in this community the same happiness and excitement I'm feeling. ❤  


That being said, I'm looking for some fun party ideas: themes, games, decorations, invitations...etc. Is a NOT a baby shower too much? I'm far away from my family, and my boyfriend's family doesn't care about us having kids, so I feel like I can go as out there as I want with this. What sounds like fun to you guys?

birth control or something else? I've gone 155 days without a period.,"Also is 40-45 days (usually closer to 45) normal cycle length? I'm 23 years old. I got my first period at age 15 in case that's relevant.


So here's the timeline: 

1. January 2015--has been 3 months since my last depo shot. Stopped it because it sucks so much. Not using any birth control. 


2. May 2015--get copper IUD. Lots of cramping for awhile. A tiny bit of spotting for a short time but no period for 40 days. Up until September 2015 they are 40-45 days apart. 


3. Mid-September 2015--IUD is expelled. September is the last period I've had. 


4. Mid-November 2015--Yay! Doctor does the Essure procedure.  I've tried enough brands of pills both combo and mini to know none of them will work due to major and many side effects. 
However I know I have to wait three months until I know if Essure is effective so I am willing to use the pill for that short time. 


5. Mid-Endish November 2015--Stop the pill because it causes a grand mal seizure. Luckily my particular seizure medications don't make the bc pill less effective but the pill makes those medications less effective at controlling seizures.


6. End of February 2016 (now)--Still no period. I haven't been able to get the HSG test for Essure yet because I need to take off work even though it's been over 3 months with Essure. 




Only birth control I'm using are condoms. Not pregnant though. 






Condoms make me bleed a little 1-2 days after sex. But no period. 
*BTW because I know at least some redditors will comment about this. There's no way to change this because it happens even with enough wetness that we don't feel any friction (I've made sure to shorten foreplay because too much of it makes sex pointless--and anyway foreplay is annoying) and it happens with every partner so it's not dick size.

"I had a discouraging talk (to me) with bf. Not sure if I should just let things go, or do something about it. (loooooong)","Hi CF. I will try to make this not a novel: [I think I failed at this]


I'm die-hard childfree and I have been since I was six. Current boyfriend, been with him for almost 2.5 years, best one I've ever had. When we started dating, I made it clear that I was CF, he said he didn't know. I figured that was fine because we didn't know we'd get into a serious relationship or a fling (I was moving away in like 3 months). Stayed together. At some point, maybe a year or so ago, we have a CF discussion, brought up by me. He said since his father was shitty he sort of feels like he'd like to be able to be a good father to some kid some day. I explain that I will never give him children, he says he is okay with that. He thought I was in a phase, I explain clearly again that I am not, this [my feeling of CF-ness] isn't going anywhere. He is okay with all of this.


Time goes on, I get more and more vocal about the CF-ness, and the anti-kid attitude. I discover r/childfree, and am always on it. (this is a throwaway, or at least not my main btw). I talk openly about IUDs, Essure, Tubals, endometrial ablasion, and he is fine with everything, accepting even. Saying things such as, ""That's awesome honey, if that will make you happy, go for it."" 


Somewhere here I make a huge mistake. I misread and misinterpret his acceptance of all my spewed vitriol as that maybe he's seen the light and is sort of childfree too. Here I will mention that at one point earlier in our relationship when I was having uterus problems he OFFERED to get a vasectomy. I said no, that I am the no-holds-barred CF-er and if someone is getting a surgery it will be ME.


So I go to the doctor this week, she asks me if my boyfriend is CF too. I said, ""I think so."" She asked, ""Well why doesn't he get a vasectomy? It's easier than you getting sterilized."" I don't quite agree with that sentiment but whatever. I told her same thing, i.e., I'm the die-hard CF-er, I will be getting the surgery(ies).


I never should have asked, I knew it was murky territory and every time I bring it up, we reach some half-cocked decision and I get upset. I asked my bf if he would consider getting a vasectomy. He said ""no."" I should have let it be. I asked ""Why?"" He said ""I might want to have kids someday."" And then I get upset (not hulk angry, more sad, freak out upset).


The thing that I really really don't get though is what came out of my bf's mouth during this whole exchange. I think he's deluded to be honest and I want opinions.


He understands I will not succumb to pregnancy, and he is pro abortion should I become pregnant. He said that ""If I decide I want a kid, I will do it on my own. Will me spending time with a kid make you jealous?""


WTF?


He didn't mean he was going to get some woman knocked up, steal her baby and peace out, he also didn't mean he was going to swipe a kid from the local K-mart. He means that he will adopt a kid, and will I be jealous of him splitting his time. He said (deluded) that I'll never have to do anything with the kid or even SEE IT. How the hell...


I asked him why he wanted a kid. He said so that he could experience unconditional love. I believe you can experience that with relationships, and he agrees. We do love each other very much (except for this shit.)


He says he wants someone to take care of him when he is old. I told him (this morning not last night) that that is one of the weakest arguments for having children ever. There is NO guarantee your kids will take care of you at all. Moving on...


I explained adoption is expensive and that kids are expensive. HE AGREED. Even went so far as to say, ""Yeah I may not make enough money to have a kid or adopt one and I don't believe in raising a kid half-assed."" That's good at least.


He also said that they weren't ""fun"" (like what a playmate for you?) for the first several years. So....you don't want the baby-toddler-small smelly hurricane stage but you want one you can talk to. He mentioned talking to it.


I'm sorry but what the actual fuck, CF? I just can't wrap my head around this. One hand, and I told him this, I feel that breaking up would allow him time to find a woman to give him that kid and a white picket fence. However he ASSURES ME that it isn't the woman thing. It's just a kid thing. If he wants a kid, he'll get one...somehow.


The other hand, he still sounds like a fence sitter. Also sounds like he wants to pick and choose the best parts. He's mid -twenties and no, I don't think he has ever sat down and REALLY thought of the consequences of either natural or adopted children. He isn't dumb, but very ""live in the moment and don't sweat the future which hasn't happened yet."" I, however; have thought about all the aspects of children - natural and adopted. I am 150% sure that I will not have natural children. The adoption thing? I think it is great to adopt, but I just don't know if it is for me. It is still a kid and they skeeve me out. 


Everything he has said though is just. so. weird though! Thanks for reading if you made it this far.

Not sure if I should just let things go, or do something about it. (loooooong) Hi CF. I will try to make this not a novel: [I think I failed at this]


I'm die-hard childfree and I have been since I was six. Current boyfriend, been with him for almost 2.5 years, best one I've ever had. When we started dating, I made it clear that I was CF, he said he didn't know. I figured that was fine because we didn't know we'd get into a serious relationship or a fling (I was moving away in like 3 months). Stayed together. At some point, maybe a year or so ago, we have a CF discussion, brought up by me. He said since his father was shitty he sort of feels like he'd like to be able to be a good father to some kid some day. I explain that I will never give him children, he says he is okay with that. He thought I was in a phase, I explain clearly again that I am not, this [my feeling of CF-ness] isn't going anywhere. He is okay with all of this.


Time goes on, I get more and more vocal about the CF-ness, and the anti-kid attitude. I discover r/childfree, and am always on it. (this is a throwaway, or at least not my main btw). I talk openly about IUDs, Essure, Tubals, endometrial ablasion, and he is fine with everything, accepting even. Saying things such as, ""That's awesome honey, if that will make you happy, go for it."" 


Somewhere here I make a huge mistake. I misread and misinterpret his acceptance of all my spewed vitriol as that maybe he's seen the light and is sort of childfree too. Here I will mention that at one point earlier in our relationship when I was having uterus problems he OFFERED to get a vasectomy. I said no, that I am the no-holds-barred CF-er and if someone is getting a surgery it will be ME.


So I go to the doctor this week, she asks me if my boyfriend is CF too. I said, ""I think so."" She asked, ""Well why doesn't he get a vasectomy? It's easier than you getting sterilized."" I don't quite agree with that sentiment but whatever. I told her same thing, i.e., I'm the die-hard CF-er, I will be getting the surgery(ies).


I never should have asked, I knew it was murky territory and every time I bring it up, we reach some half-cocked decision and I get upset. I asked my bf if he would consider getting a vasectomy. He said ""no."" I should have let it be. I asked ""Why?"" He said ""I might want to have kids someday."" And then I get upset (not hulk angry, more sad, freak out upset).


The thing that I really really don't get though is what came out of my bf's mouth during this whole exchange. I think he's deluded to be honest and I want opinions.


He understands I will not succumb to pregnancy, and he is pro abortion should I become pregnant. He said that ""If I decide I want a kid, I will do it on my own. Will me spending time with a kid make you jealous?""


WTF?


He didn't mean he was going to get some woman knocked up, steal her baby and peace out, he also didn't mean he was going to swipe a kid from the local K-mart. He means that he will adopt a kid, and will I be jealous of him splitting his time. He said (deluded) that I'll never have to do anything with the kid or even SEE IT. How the hell...

"Bilateral Salpingectomy Experience, UK (X-posted with r/Sterilization)","Hi all, just created this account to share my experience of getting a bilateral salpingectomy in the UK. 

**Background**

I'm 30 years old, female, bisexual but in a long term relationship with a man. I have never wanted children and I have always wanted to be sterilised.

I used the contraceptive pill plus a barrier method from age 15 through to my early 20s, then I moved to Implanon plus a barrier method. However, I always wanted to take away all risk of pregnancy and stop taking artificial hormones (which in the past few years have really fucked with my skin plus given me ovarian cysts) so I started more seriously researching sterilization on the NHS with the goal of achieving it by 30 (boom, done).

My partner considered vasectomy but I told him I would still want to be sterilized anyway because if the Handmaid's Tale comes, I'd rather be dead or drugged up in the brothel than a broodmare. He's technically firing fucked up sperm anyway due to the side effects of a medication he's on for a chronic autoimmune condition, so if one of our friends gets pregnant with a slug in the coming weeks while I'm off the D, then I'll know what he was up to. I'm kidding, of course.

**Female Sterilization on the NHS**

I visited my GP and told her I wanted to work towards getting sterilized. I thought she'd be great about it because  she's worked together with me on other health issues and is generally fantastic about self-care and patient input. Alas, I got the full bingo of bullshit and I couldn't be arsed to argue with her on that date because I also needed some treatment for my fucked up skin (thanks artificial hormones). I listened to the usual stuff about how I might change my mind, the risks, other options, how she had never thought she'd have a family at 30, but 5 years later it was baby time, then I went away with a pamphlet on the mirena coil, which I knew I didn't want.

I went back again to discuss at a later date and asserted myself more strongly this time. Again, she started in on the bingo: general anaesthesia is incredibly risky (nope, the stats don't lie), I might change my mind (well that's my responsibility, not yours) this is PERMANENT (yeah that's the point), she's only ever referred two patients for sterilization and they both came back with the mirena (so they were worn down into changing their minds then) etc etc. She then also warned me that it might NOT be permanent and I could end up with an ectopic pregnancy. I pointed out that this wouldn't be a risk with a salp because the tubes are completely removed, but apparently the NHS only offers tubal occlusion (cutting, clips, or rings) or essure (blocking the tube from within), and salp is only an option if those methods fail. So I was being warned against sterilization because I would no longer be able to conceive PERMANENTLY, but also because it might not be as PERMANENT as I would like it to be. 

At this point, I decided to research the option of getting a salp privately.

Just to be clear - I love the NHS. I am 100% supportive of the NHS. I actually work for the NHS in various roles. Ideally I'd prefer to see the system work a lot better and for me to have received my salp that way, but that clearly wasn't going to happen any time soon and I hate fucking around, so I am glad that I had the option to go private. I will, however, be sharing my experience and trying to change the system from within so that others don't have to do what I did.

**Booking via private health care**

I got online and started emailing all the private health care providers I could find. One day later, a doctor called Cameron Martin, based in Edinburgh, came back to me with an email with the subject line ""Tubes!!"" From then on, I christened him Dr Tubes. I asked him if I could recommend him to others by name in this group and he said he'd be more than happy for me to do so. I would like to add him to the side-bar in r/Childfree but I don't have enough posts/karma on this account yet. Can anyone help?

Anyway, he works for the NHS but also does private care via Spire. He said he'd be happy to do the procedure and he does them regularly. We had an over the phone consultation because I live in a remote area so we couldn't meet in person. He checked in about my height, weight, allergies, any previous surgeries etc. In his own words, he's not interested in being paternalistic about the reasoning behind the surgery, so all he cared about was that I had the information on risks, procedure, outcomes etc and when he was satisfied that I had done my research and I was happy with him as a consultant, he referred it back to Spire to book in the surgery at the Murrayfield Hospital in Edinburgh. They quoted me an all-in cost of £3100. I'm very fortunate that I was able to cover this cost, so I booked it in and paid up front. They have other payment options, but I was lucky enough to have the resource to pay up front without interest, so I went for it.

**Before the Surgery**

The week before the surgery they sent me out a questionnaire and various admission papers for signing. It asked about all the usual stuff - height, weight, allergies, previous surgeries, pregnancy, reaction to anaesthetic, health, family history, dietary requirements, aftercare arrangements etc. In advance of the surgery, I got my piercings replaced with non-metal jewellery so that I wouldn't get burned if they had to shock me for whatever reason. 

The night before, I stopped eating at 8pm. I was told to only drink clear liquids after that and to stop drinking 1.5 hours before my admission time. There were no other requirements. On the morning of the surgery I had a shower and got myself sparkly clean, then put on a very fetching tracksuit (I wanted something soft for post surgery). I also had to bring a dressing gown and slippers with me.

**The Surgery**

I was booked in as a Day Case, but was told that if anything went wrong I'd get to stay over and it wouldn't cost anything extra. My admission time was 11am. My friend drove me and my partner to the hospital where I was checked into a private room with toilet. I had to take a pregnancy test, answer all the questions again with my nurse, the anaesthetist, and then Dr Tubes himself. 

Dr Tubes was brilliant and put both my partner and I totally at ease. He's absolutely hyper and gave me the giggles when he asked, ""Is there anything else I can do while I'm in there?"" I had no idea what he meant, so I said ""Scale and polish? MOT?"" He actually was asking whether I wanted a smear test, removal of coil (if I had one), and photographs during op! I said yes to the smear and photos, and asked if he could remove the Implanon from my arm while I was under too. He said no problem. That's service for you. No-one, at any point, questioned me or gave me any funny looks about the procedure. It was all just business as usual.

At midday, I was given a gown and compression socks. I was also given gigantic see-through paper pants that are apparently optional, but will be cut off anyway, so I opted to go commando and save them the trouble. At 1pm I was called by the nurse, popped on my dressing gown and slippers, and we walked down the hall to see the anaesthetist. He got a cannula in my hand and started chatting to me about my hobbies. I'm a musician and I'm in a band, so in an utterly surreal move, he found my band's album on Spotify and started playing it and dancing around the room! Then I felt myself getting drowsy and I was out.

Next thing I knew I was waking up in the recovery room. I won't lie, I was extremely uncomfortable. I had the terrible shakes; I just could not stop shivering. I heard a nurse list a bunch of the medicines I'd had (I remember Fentanyl but that's it). I was trying to open my eyes, but the light seemed far too bright. The room looked massive and white and there were other patients in there recovering. I was so cold and shivery. They put electric blankets on me and then gave me two 50mg Tramadol and a sip of water. 15 mins later the Tramadol started to take effect and I felt a little bit warmer and less sore, but I was still shivering like my chihuahuas when they see the postie.

They wheeled me back to my room where I opened my eyes to see if I could find my partner. He was waiting in the room and I felt a lot better knowing he was there. The nurse checked my wounds, blood pressure, and pulse every 15 mins at first, and I shivered and shivered and felt like absolute shit on a stick. Then I finally stopped shivering around 3pm and was able to open my eyes and chat with the nurse a little. She asked about my pain and I rated it at maybe a 7. She gave me a 30mg dihydrocodeine and I went on an hour long trip where I basically just held on to the little table in front of me and saw loads of images like the drug trip episode of Bojack Horseman. I did not enjoy that.

After an hour though it settled down and I felt better - pain down to about a 3/10, able to open my eyes and stop clinging on to the table for dear life. During this time the nurse had been taking my blood pressure, pulse, and checking my wounds every 30 mins. They wanted me to eat some food and drink some water, but I didn't feel able yet. They were concerned because my pulse was at 120bpm and I have a family history of blood clots, so they kept a close eye on me. I do tend towards low blood pressure and a fast pulse though, so I let them know that.

Around 5pm I tried drinking some sugary tea and managed a couple of ginger biscuits. At 6pm they brought me a vegetable and pesto panini and tried really hard to get me to eat. I really didn't want it, but managed to get it down and lo and behold, it helped and I felt a bit better again.

They kept checking on me regularly and were considering keeping me overnight because my pulse was so high, but then it slowly started to go down. By 7.30pm it was in the mid-90s and I was feeling a lot better. 

At 8pm, Dr Tubes came in and showed me my photographs, which were incredible. He took a before, a during, and an after. As well as this, he took one to show me that I had had appendicitis in the past that hadn't received treatment, which was a MAJOR ""aha!"" moment for me because when I was 15 I got really, super, agonisingly sick and was told by my doctor that it was all in my head. That doctor then tried to get me to pray with him to feel better (I shit you not). I then promptly vomited all over his office (which I don't feel bad about because fuck the guy) and went to A&amp;E where I was checked in, but left with basically no treatment and no pain relief, just sitting in a bed for two days in agony. I blame that doctor for briefing A&amp;E saying it was in my head, so they pretty much ignored me. Now I know what it was and I was just lucky the appendix didn't burst. I wish I'd had the self confidence to complain at the time, but I cannot tell you how vindicating it was finding that out. Thanks Dr Tubes - all the extra bonuses!

By 9pm my pulse was in the 80s and they were happy for me to go home, provided I managed to pee first. Peeing wasn't actually that bad. I broke my back a couple of years ago and trying to pee for the first time after that was WAY worse. I got my sexy tracksuit on and my friend kindly picked my partner and I up. They gave me more dressings, explained how and when to change them, and gave me paracetamol and dihydrocodeine to take away. Unfortunately I'm allergic to NSAIDs so I can't take ibuprofen or naproxen.

Sleeping that night was not that bad. I took half a dihydrocodeine every 4-5 hours, plus 2x paracetamol, and slept on my back. I hate back sleeping, but when I broke my back I had to do a lot of it, so at least I was prepared.

**Recovery**

The day after the surgery wasn't too bad. My belly was super swollen from the CO2 they pump in there and it was irritating my old back injury, which sucked, but the incisions weren't too sore. Day 2 was worse, the gas bubble became very uncomfortable and I felt like my stomach was so swollen I couldn't breathe, eat or drink properly, or even lie down comfortable. The pain did radiate up into my traps and kept trying to put my back injury into spasm. Hurray. On day 3 I had to get a flight and that SUCKED. I ended up having to get a wheelchair because I just couldn't manage the airport walking. On day 4 I started bleeding and it wasn't like a normal period, so I presume that was the wastage finding it's way out. It stung a fair bit. Day 5, I still hadn't managed to poop and this compounded all the pain and discomfort. I didn't get any stool softners or laxatives, but luckily we had some in the house already so I took those and finally managed to poop that night. It wasn't fun.

Tomorrow it'll be 1 week since I had the surgery and I think I'm a slow healer because it still hurts a fair bit. The incisions are the sorest thing now, but I am still swollen with a hard little round stomach. I've read other accounts on here and I definitely seem to be recovering a lot slower than others, but that's maybe just natural human variation. Certainly, when I broke my back I was in the brace for something like 3-4 weeks longer than average, so apparently I'm just shit at healing. Thank god I'm never going to be pregnant.

So, that's it for now! If you have any questions about my extremely long-winded post, please don't hesitate to ask. I'll be happy to provide a further update once I'm more healed.

experience uk,"Bilateral Salpingectomy Experience, UK (X-posted with r/Sterilization) Hi all, just created this account to share my experience of getting a bilateral salpingectomy in the UK. 

**Background**

I'm 30 years old, female, bisexual but in a long term relationship with a man. I have never wanted children and I have always wanted to be sterilised.

I used the contraceptive pill plus a barrier method from age 15 through to my early 20s, then I moved to Implanon plus a barrier method. However, I always wanted to take away all risk of pregnancy and stop taking artificial hormones (which in the past few years have really fucked with my skin plus given me ovarian cysts) so I started more seriously researching sterilization on the NHS with the goal of achieving it by 30 (boom, done).

My partner considered vasectomy but I told him I would still want to be sterilized anyway because if the Handmaid's Tale comes, I'd rather be dead or drugged up in the brothel than a broodmare. He's technically firing fucked up sperm anyway due to the side effects of a medication he's on for a chronic autoimmune condition, so if one of our friends gets pregnant with a slug in the coming weeks while I'm off the D, then I'll know what he was up to. I'm kidding, of course.

**Female Sterilization on the NHS**

I visited my GP and told her I wanted to work towards getting sterilized. I thought she'd be great about it because  she's worked together with me on other health issues and is generally fantastic about self-care and patient input. Alas, I got the full bingo of bullshit and I couldn't be arsed to argue with her on that date because I also needed some treatment for my fucked up skin (thanks artificial hormones). I listened to the usual stuff about how I might change my mind, the risks, other options, how she had never thought she'd have a family at 30, but 5 years later it was baby time, then I went away with a pamphlet on the mirena coil, which I knew I didn't want.

I went back again to discuss at a later date and asserted myself more strongly this time. Again, she started in on the bingo: general anaesthesia is incredibly risky (nope, the stats don't lie), I might change my mind (well that's my responsibility, not yours) this is PERMANENT (yeah that's the point), she's only ever referred two patients for sterilization and they both came back with the mirena (so they were worn down into changing their minds then) etc etc. She then also warned me that it might NOT be permanent and I could end up with an ectopic pregnancy. I pointed out that this wouldn't be a risk with a salp because the tubes are completely removed, but apparently the NHS only offers tubal occlusion (cutting, clips, or rings) or essure (blocking the tube from within), and salp is only an option if those methods fail. So I was being warned against sterilization because I would no longer be able to conceive PERMANENTLY, but also because it might not be as PERMANENT as I would like it to be. 

At this point, I decided to research the option of getting a salp privately.

Just to be clear - I love the NHS. I am 100% supportive of the NHS. I actually work for the NHS in various roles. Ideally I'd prefer to see the system work a lot better and for me to have received my salp that way, but that clearly wasn't going to happen any time soon and I hate fucking around, so I am glad that I had the option to go private. I will, however, be sharing my experience and trying to change the system from within so that others don't have to do what I did.

**Booking via private health care**

I got online and started emailing all the private health care providers I could find. One day later, a doctor called Cameron Martin, based in Edinburgh, came back to me with an email with the subject line ""Tubes!!"" From then on, I christened him Dr Tubes. I asked him if I could recommend him to others by name in this group and he said he'd be more than happy for me to do so. I would like to add him to the side-bar in r/Childfree but I don't have enough posts/karma on this account yet. Can anyone help?

Anyway, he works for the NHS but also does private care via Spire. He said he'd be happy to do the procedure and he does them regularly. We had an over the phone consultation because I live in a remote area so we couldn't meet in person. He checked in about my height, weight, allergies, any previous surgeries etc. In his own words, he's not interested in being paternalistic about the reasoning behind the surgery, so all he cared about was that I had the information on risks, procedure, outcomes etc and when he was satisfied that I had done my research and I was happy with him as a consultant, he referred it back to Spire to book in the surgery at the Murrayfield Hospital in Edinburgh. They quoted me an all-in cost of £3100. I'm very fortunate that I was able to cover this cost, so I booked it in and paid up front. They have other payment options, but I was lucky enough to have the resource to pay up front without interest, so I went for it.

**Before the Surgery**

The week before the surgery they sent me out a questionnaire and various admission papers for signing. It asked about all the usual stuff - height, weight, allergies, previous surgeries, pregnancy, reaction to anaesthetic, health, family history, dietary requirements, aftercare arrangements etc. In advance of the surgery, I got my piercings replaced with non-metal jewellery so that I wouldn't get burned if they had to shock me for whatever reason. 

The night before, I stopped eating at 8pm. I was told to only drink clear liquids after that and to stop drinking 1.5 hours before my admission time. There were no other requirements. On the morning of the surgery I had a shower and got myself sparkly clean, then put on a very fetching tracksuit (I wanted something soft for post surgery). I also had to bring a dressing gown and slippers with me.

**The Surgery**

I was booked in as a Day Case, but was told that if anything went wrong I'd get to stay over and it wouldn't cost anything extra. My admission time was 11am. My friend drove me and my partner to the hospital where I was checked into a private room with toilet. I had to take a pregnancy test, answer all the questions again with my nurse, the anaesthetist, and then Dr Tubes himself. 

Dr Tubes was brilliant and put both my partner and I totally at ease. He's absolutely hyper and gave me the giggles when he asked, ""Is there anything else I can do while I'm in there?"" I had no idea what he meant, so I said ""Scale and polish? MOT?"" He actually was asking whether I wanted a smear test, removal of coil (if I had one), and photographs during op! I said yes to the smear and photos, and asked if he could remove the Implanon from my arm while I was under too. He said no problem. That's service for you. No-one, at any point, questioned me or gave me any funny looks about the procedure. It was all just business as usual.

At midday, I was given a gown and compression socks. I was also given gigantic see-through paper pants that are apparently optional, but will be cut off anyway, so I opted to go commando and save them the trouble. At 1pm I was called by the nurse, popped on my dressing gown and slippers, and we walked down the hall to see the anaesthetist. He got a cannula in my hand and started chatting to me about my hobbies. I'm a musician and I'm in a band, so in an utterly surreal move, he found my band's album on Spotify and started playing it and dancing around the room! Then I felt myself getting drowsy and I was out.

Next thing I knew I was waking up in the recovery room. I won't lie, I was extremely uncomfortable. I had the terrible shakes; I just could not stop shivering. I heard a nurse list a bunch of the medicines I'd had (I remember Fentanyl but that's it). I was trying to open my eyes, but the light seemed far too bright. The room looked massive and white and there were other patients in there recovering. I was so cold and shivery. They put electric blankets on me and then gave me two 50mg Tramadol and a sip of water. 15 mins later the Tramadol started to take effect and I felt a little bit warmer and less sore, but I was still shivering like my chihuahuas when they see the postie.

They wheeled me back to my room where I opened my eyes to see if I could find my partner. He was waiting in the room and I felt a lot better knowing he was there. The nurse checked my wounds, blood pressure, and pulse every 15 mins at first, and I shivered and shivered and felt like absolute shit on a stick. Then I finally stopped shivering around 3pm and was able to open my eyes and chat with the nurse a little. She asked about my pain and I rated it at maybe a 7. She gave me a 30mg dihydrocodeine and I went on an hour long trip where I basically just held on to the little table in front of me and saw loads of images like the drug trip episode of Bojack Horseman. I did not enjoy that.

After an hour though it settled down and I felt better - pain down to about a 3/10, able to open my eyes and stop clinging on to the table for dear life. During this time the nurse had been taking my blood pressure, pulse, and checking my wounds every 30 mins. They wanted me to eat some food and drink some water, but I didn't feel able yet. They were concerned because my pulse was at 120bpm and I have a family history of blood clots, so they kept a close eye on me. I do tend towards low blood pressure and a fast pulse though, so I let them know that.

Around 5pm I tried drinking some sugary tea and managed a couple of ginger biscuits. At 6pm they brought me a vegetable and pesto panini and tried really hard to get me to eat. I really didn't want it, but managed to get it down and lo and behold, it helped and I felt a bit better again.

They kept checking on me regularly and were considering keeping me overnight because my pulse was so high, but then it slowly started to go down. By 7.30pm it was in the mid-90s and I was feeling a lot better. 

At 8pm, Dr Tubes came in and showed me my photographs, which were incredible. He took a before, a during, and an after. As well as this, he took one to show me that I had had appendicitis in the past that hadn't received treatment, which was a MAJOR ""aha!"" moment for me because when I was 15 I got really, super, agonisingly sick and was told by my doctor that it was all in my head. That doctor then tried to get me to pray with him to feel better (I shit you not). I then promptly vomited all over his office (which I don't feel bad about because fuck the guy) and went to A&amp;E where I was checked in, but left with basically no treatment and no pain relief, just sitting in a bed for two days in agony. I blame that doctor for briefing A&amp;E saying it was in my head, so they pretty much ignored me. Now I know what it was and I was just lucky the appendix didn't burst. I wish I'd had the self confidence to complain at the time, but I cannot tell you how vindicating it was finding that out. Thanks Dr Tubes - all the extra bonuses!

By 9pm my pulse was in the 80s and they were happy for me to go home, provided I managed to pee first. Peeing wasn't actually that bad. I broke my back a couple of years ago and trying to pee for the first time after that was WAY worse. I got my sexy tracksuit on and my friend kindly picked my partner and I up. They gave me more dressings, explained how and when to change them, and gave me paracetamol and dihydrocodeine to take away. Unfortunately I'm allergic to NSAIDs so I can't take ibuprofen or naproxen.

Sleeping that night was not that bad. I took half a dihydrocodeine every 4-5 hours, plus 2x paracetamol, and slept on my back. I hate back sleeping, but when I broke my back I had to do a lot of it, so at least I was prepared.

**Recovery**

The day after the surgery wasn't too bad. My belly was super swollen from the CO2 they pump in there and it was irritating my old back injury, which sucked, but the incisions weren't too sore. Day 2 was worse, the gas bubble became very uncomfortable and I felt like my stomach was so swollen I couldn't breathe, eat or drink properly, or even lie down comfortable. The pain did radiate up into my traps and kept trying to put my back injury into spasm. Hurray. On day 3 I had to get a flight and that SUCKED. I ended up having to get a wheelchair because I just couldn't manage the airport walking. On day 4 I started bleeding and it wasn't like a normal period, so I presume that was the wastage finding it's way out. It stung a fair bit. Day 5, I still hadn't managed to poop and this compounded all the pain and discomfort. I didn't get any stool softners or laxatives, but luckily we had some in the house already so I took those and finally managed to poop that night. It wasn't fun.

Tomorrow it'll be 1 week since I had the surgery and I think I'm a slow healer because it still hurts a fair bit. The incisions are the sorest thing now, but I am still swollen with a hard little round stomach. I've read other accounts on here and I definitely seem to be recovering a lot slower than others, but that's maybe just natural human variation. Certainly, when I broke my back I was in the brace for something like 3-4 weeks longer than average, so apparently I'm just shit at healing. Thank god I'm never going to be pregnant.

So, that's it for now! If you have any questions about my extremely long-winded post, please don't hesitate to ask. I'll be happy to provide a further update once I'm more healed.

How to state my case to my dr for sterilization? 22/F,"I don't want children, and have been looking into essure.  I know that doctors seriously take mental soundness into account, especially for someone my age.  

How the heck do I argue that I am mentally stable enough to make this decision, which is that I do not want to reproduce and pass on my mental problems?

I have had serious depression and anxiety since I was a little kid.  It got so bad that I had to do something about it, so caught it before it slipped into the alcoholism that runs in my family.  Ended up going on meds when my daily panic attacks over ""nothing"" got in the way of my basic functioning.  Now I've been stable off meds for a few years and am taking more pleasure in things.  

But I'll never forget the years of spiraling down.  It's a terrible feeling to wish you were never born, that it's not fair that you didn't have a choice in being born.  I don't want to put a child in that position, and it would be heartbreaking to watch an offspring struggle with the issues I had, which seem to be hereditary.

In the future, if I can, I would like to adopt. I think I could be a good parent if I'm not also recovering from childbirth.  I don't want to deal with postpartum depression (which I'm at higher risk of). I don't want to fear a traumatic delivery during pregnancy.  I don't want the possibility of a miscarriage, or an abnormal fetus.  I know the limits of my anxiety and I think pregnancy would be too much for me to handle.  And I don't see why it's important that I go through it, when there are already kids here that need a family.  

Would mentioning adoption help (because they're concerned about ""regrets"" and I'm showing I do have a plan for children that I'm excited about) or hurt (because I may come off as unsure in my decision for sterilization)? 

Now I'm using condoms with my monogamous bf.  But my period is super irregular and often skips months, and I hate having the persistent idea of possible pregnancy in my mind, which would for sure end in abortion.

I know, I would not tell ALL this info to my dr, I want to have a put together, rational case to present, not a list of fears about childbirth.  

TL;DR- 1. I've dealt with mental problems so bad that I don't want to pass them on to kids, but not so bad that I can't make a competent, permanent decision. Contradictory? 2. Should I mention adoption? (22 yr old)

I'm 31, and I'm pretty sure I've never wanted kids for as long as a remember (or since the first time my mom yelled at shitty little child-me ""Just wait until you have kids of your own!"")  My husband has 2 kids...in their teens, and I'm obviously ok with them since it wasn't my twat they fell out of (plus, they're pretty decent...you know...for teens) and my husband agreed that 2 was enough, and since he had them extremely young, he's enjoying his mid 30's with 2 small humans that can pretty much function on their own, while his other 30 something friends are currently dealing with poop factories and a less than satisfactory social life.  

Anyhoo, we just got married in october, and after joking around for years that I was going to cauterize my insides, I finally inquired into it at Planned Parenthood.  We had a consultation, and a month later I had the procedure done.  

Let's just say if any doctor offers vicodin before a procedure--take it!  I didn't but I was begging for it afterwards.  Worst cramps ever.  It's a weird procedure that you're awake for, but the day after I was a little crampy, but pretty much fine.  hit the gym 2 days later, no probs.  

Now I just have to wait the 3 months and go in to the lab and let them squirt xray juice into my cooch to make sure the tubes are nice and scarred up.  IN the meantime though, back on the NuvaRing just to make sure.

My husband has 2 kids...in their teens, and I'm obviously ok with them since it wasn't my twat they fell out of (plus, they're pretty decent...you know...for teens) and my husband agreed that 2 was enough, and since he had them extremely young, he's enjoying his mid 30's with 2 small humans that can pretty much function on their own, while his other 30 something friends are currently dealing with poop factories and a less than satisfactory social life.  

Anyhoo, we just got married in october, and after joking around for years that I was going to cauterize my insides, I finally inquired into it at Planned Parenthood.  We had a consultation, and a month later I had the procedure done.  

Let's just say if any doctor offers vicodin before a procedure--take it!  I didn't but I was begging for it afterwards.  Worst cramps ever.  It's a weird procedure that you're awake for, but the day after I was a little crampy, but pretty much fine.  hit the gym 2 days later, no probs.  

Now I just have to wait the 3 months and go in to the lab and let them squirt xray juice into my cooch to make sure the tubes are nice and scarred up.  IN the meantime though, back on the NuvaRing just to make sure.

No regrets.  I plan on many fur babies though. ;) ",new procedure done friend actually told subreddit procedure done lurking bit decided join pretty sure never wanted kid long remember since first time mom yelled shitty little wait kid husband kid teen obviously ok since twat fell plus pretty decent know teen husband agreed enough since extremely young enjoying mid small human pretty much function something friend currently dealing poop factory less satisfactory social life anyhoo got married october joking around year going cauterize inside finally inquired planned parenthood consultation month later procedure done let say doctor offer vicodin procedure take begging afterwards worst cramp ever weird procedure awake day little crampy pretty much fine hit gym day later probs wait month lab let squirt xray juice cooch sure tube nice scarred meantime though back nuvaring sure regret plan many fur baby though

Is anyone using ESSURE? ,"I just discovered this subreddit (love it completely!) and noticed a link in a reply for Essure.  Is anyone using this?

No patronizing questions, no holier than thou lecturing. I asked about permanent BC because my IUD has been giving me a lot of issues with bleeding and spotting.

Any women here on Quartette?,"I was hoping to here some experiences on this BC option. I had my first gyno exam today (yeah...23 and never went to one before) to discuss birth control and PMDD. I took my chances to ask about permanent sterilization but the doctor glazed right over that with this being my first visit and my being so young.

She put me on Quartette for my PMDD since it only gives you periods every 3 months. I'm not sure what to expect and it has me a little nervous. If anyone here is on it I'd love to hear your experience!

 The doctor was very hesitant to go straight for an IUD as she was worried the pain would be too severe. Plus the exam itself had me in near tears (I hate strangers touching me) and she didn't want to do something even more invasive.

After talking with her for a bit she did say she was willing  to discuss the Essure permanent sterilization option with me  sometime in the near future. The doctor who preforms them at this clinic did so for a 26yr old so I feel I have a good shot at convincing her.

Well I've signed the paperwork!,"(Couple quick things about myself. I am extremely Tokophobic, and I also have depression. Pregnancy is my all time worst fear ever. I think about it everyday and it would keep me from having sex if I ever found someone. In other words becoming sterile is one of the most important things in my life. This is fairly detailed cause I'm one of those awful people who has to explain the whole movie or book when you ask what it's about, because it all seems important even if it's not. Hence the wall of text SORRY bout that.) 

Went to the OBGYN today to ask for Essure today. Before going in I was nervous but I had made a book of articles and stories, and it talked a bit about myself. I am extremely proud of it and it's probably going to get shown to anyone I can get to look at it. Both the nurse and Dr. were very polite and respectful. No bingos from hell or horror stories of laughter and degradation so that was good. As soon as I started talking to the Dr. I felt reluctance on her part. She said that every Dr. has to have a limit and thus far hers has been age 25 (I'm 22 almost 23). 

I felt myself getting upset cause you know this is important to me. I was biting my lip hard trying my damnedest to not cry in front of her (I absolutely HATE crying in front of anyone that isn't my mom. Unfortunately to my own ire I am rather sensitive. I am working on it tho :D) Of course that didn't work, and she apologized for upsetting me, and handed my Kleenexes. She took my book and started to go through it a bit asking me questions like about my Tokophobia, and what it's like for me. As she's going through it she mentions that my primary Dr.who referred me to her. Left a substantial note in my file about me as a person, and voiced support for my decision. She then said while that was great to know about me she was still just meeting me for the first time and explained that she is the one responsible if anything went wrong. I said that I understood (I've mostly pulled myself together at this point), and I don't want someone who isn't comfortable with it performing my surgery. 

Then she asked about my therapist, how long have you seen her, how long have you talked about this. I replied that I had know her for 2 yrs and we had discussed this for several months. She said if she could talk to my therapist, and get a better understanding of who I am as a person and whether or not the therapist thinks I'm stable and mature enough to make the decision. That she would do the procedure. I was like huh??? SRSYLY! Maintaining my composure we talked more. Went through the book together she brought me the paperwork I had to fill out (releases and whatnot), and we talked about dates! Before I left I shook her hand and thanked her for her professionalism, sensitivity, and understanding (She didn't talk down to me or belittle me because of my age. She listened and was very careful about the language she used so that it wasn't offensive, and there were NO BINGOS). I think I'm still in shock that she would be willing to do it, because I haven't started jumping up and down yet but that will come later.

My Essure may not have worked /rant,"Hi guys,

The whole sterilization thing has been a saga from the get go; 28 Sept I had the first essure put in place [super gyno couldn't find the other fallopian tube], had super expensive ultrasound and voila the other fallopian tube is hiding in my 2nd uterus [who'da thunk it]

The second Essure proceedure was hugely painful and difficult- one essure broke while my hidden fallopian tube was dancing the fandango so Super Gyno had to run out and get another. Fun times.

Now I've just had the 'final' test which is inconclusive and I have to go through another more painful test to see if I'm 'good to go'. The gyno warned me it's a tad more 'uncomfortable' than the essure placement. After this test I could need another friggin proceedure to finally achieve infertility.

You may remember me as the person who wrote an [angry Guardian piece](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/28/why-wont-nhs-let-me-be-sterilised) about why the National Health Service in the UK wouldn't let me get my tubes tied, or the person who [was on TV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MX04UANCm4) because they finally agreed after FOUR ACTUAL YEARS. Or the person who got [trolled loads](https://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/4hcm24/someone_wrote_a_whole_page_about_how_im_a_cunt/) because of it all.

Finally, tomorrow, I get to have the op. I am SO EXCITED. This is the last day of my life that I could get pregnant, and I'm so happy it's almost over!

I'm not having the Essure procedure because I'm allergic to nickel, so I'll be having the clips. I just wondered if any of you had advice for the operation day or the recovery? I got amazing advice from Reddit for my tonsillectomy (whoever said to get an ice crushing machine is a genius) and wondered if there was anything similar for a tubal.

Also, I just want to say a MASSIVE thank you to all of you for your support over the years.

Final steps of my essure done!,"I had my procedure done back in July.  I am 30, married and of course no kids.  My doctor didn't give me too much trouble about becoming sterile I just had some liability forms to fill out.  After that i was good to go. 
Things went fairly well.  I was out for the procedure so I remember nothing.  Some bleeding and cramping for a few weeks then ok.  

Anyway last week was my 3 month check up (yay) to make sure I was sterile.  First of all this was awful.  Evidently my lady parts are small which made it tough.  While laying there trying not to think of the pain I had a nurse trying to get me to talk about something.

First thing she asks is""How many kids do you have?"" 

Of course my answer was none I'm a dog person.  She then went on to ask some questions about my dogs which I love to talk about.  At the time were getting ready to adopt a new dog so I told her all about the adoption process we had been through and how excited we were. 

By this point the doctor was done(essure worked by the way) and came around to talk to me.  She had this look of pure joy on her face and said to me"" Awwww you're adopting!  That's so good to hear.  Boy or girl?"" 

My response""My dog?  girl."" 

Her, ""oh""

It's double silly because this is the SAME doctor that sterilized me in the first place!

Essure 2: Electric Toobaloo,"I'm so happy, I could just shit.

Some of you may remember me from my [previous tale of woe](http://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/1deoon/my_essure_consultation_is_today/) regarding a failed Essure consultation. I just want to share with you all that I had a second meeting with a new doctor today, and it was a total 180.

First of all, the new doctor's assistant was kind and warm, instead of preachy and judgmental like the previous one. To be honest, I was quite nervous about talking with the new doctor for fear of getting shut down again. That all changed when she walked in, and began to talk.

She was sure to give me a list of options, and once she was done with that, it was my turn to shine. I didn't get two words out of my mouth before she let me know that she needed no convincing - she was more than happy to oblige me. She just needed to make sure that she presented all options to me first. At that point, I almost broke down into a soppy, teary mess of joy. I kept my cool, though, because I've got a reputation to uphold.

She was actually able to convince me that tubal ligation is not a scary, awful procedure (it's laproscopic, so it's minimally invasive). I decided to go with that instead of the Essure, as I'm not sure if I'm sensitive to any metals or not. I'm tentatively slated for July 12, barring any insurance or scheduling issues.

What a huge relief.

"Tubal ligation is scheduled for August, and I have no idea what to expect.","(35/F) The consultation went well. Thanks to all of you folks, I knew what bingo questions to expect, and had planned my rebuttals in advance. It occurred to me at the time that this doctor wasn't throwing bingos at me because of ""Hey little girl, you have no idea what you want"", but rather because ethically, they just want to know that you've done your research, and to guage how serious you are.

Anyway, I'm going with filshie clips, because of the doctor's recommendation. I have also done my own research on this method (through peer-reviewed medical journals, NOT blogs, because all you'll see is horror stories) and it seems to be the simplest, most reliable, been-around-longer-than-Essure method.

The issue I'm having is that I don't know a single person who has had a tubal ligation with filshies- or otherwise- done, and it's not exactly the type of question I would pose on Facebook. I have no idea what to expect afterward, and I've never had any kind of surgery before. For those of you who have had it done:

1) Were you in much pain afterward?

2) How much time off work did you need to take?

3) Do you have any residual ill-effects?

4) How would you describe the whole experience?

Endometriosis and sterilization options?,"I have a pretty severe case of endometriosis. In all probability, I am infertile. I have an amazing gyno who worked with me without making me feel crazy for the phantom pain or belittle me for not wanting children. *She* recommended the IUD and inserted it without the ""easier if you've had kids"" crap, and it has really been a life saver at managing my pain. Unfortunately, at 3 years in, the IUD is becoming less effective. So I'm looking at my options, and I'd like a permanent one.

So, I wanted to ask any other endo CFers what they know. Obviously this conversation will also be had with my doctor, but going in well-informed always looks better even to such an accepting doctor as mine. I'm afraid of a hysterectomy. Will it trigger menopause? And what about those horrible stories where the pain continues after a hysterectomy? And scars, sorry if that's shallow but I don't want scars. A tubal won't help with my endo, and I don't believe Essure will either. The mother of a friend of mine had her uterus lining destroyed with liquid nitrogen (I believe. Second hand stories from nearly estranged daughters should always be taken with a grain of salt).

Being sterilized at 22 was one of the best choices I've ever made.,"Hello all!! Let me just start out by shouting from the rooftops how much I LOVE this subreddit. This is one of the only few places in the world where I feel completely accepted and surrounded by like-minded people.

So I'm 26, and it's been four and a half years since I got my Essure procedure done. From the ages of 12-22, I had tried damn near every form of birth control. All different types of pills, depo, the nuvaring, three different arm implants, and two copper IUDS. After my second copper IUD was a bust, after not being on BC for a while and having a brief miscarriage, I put my foot down. Enough was fucking enough. I have a barrage of mental health issues along with some physical health issues I do not ever wish to genetically pass down to anyone. I also have a severely autistic older brother, and while I love him dearly, I've gone through my whole life accepting that when something happens to my parents, I'm stepping in to help care for him. I've seen what raising a severely autistic child does to young parents who are emotionally unstable themselves and there's no way in hell I wanted that life for myself.

So I contacted my doctors. At first, I got rejected. I got told ""we just need to wait a while, try an IUD while you wait."" I got told I'd regret it, that most young, unmarried, childless women end up regretting getting sterilized later in life because they ""change their minds"". I got LIVID. And I went OFF. I explained clearly that no, I'm not going to wait around and have another miscarriage or have another IUD float out of my body. Between my mental health and physical health issues, I'm not passing that shit on to another undeserving human. Ironically at the time, I was in college for child development because I believed whatever little maternal extincts I had would be best suited maybe helping raise other people's little brats, because at least at the end of the day I would get to go home to my own life. I told my doctor this too. I also told her my views on overpopulation and how that wasn't changing. I also mentioned how if it REALLY came down to it, if I REALLY changed my mind about having kids (news flash: still haven't) than there's no shortage of children who need to be adopted or fostered that I could ""change my mind"" and do that. But you can't change your mind and unbirth a child that's already been born. And after my lengthy rant, I also mentioned that as a doctor you can't deny me a preventative procedure that's not detrimental to my health, and I'd be happy to get a lawyer if she disagreed. I was 21 at the time, so I had to wait until I was 22 to get the procedure.

And I did. I got my Essure procedure done at 22 as a poor, mentally unstable mess still living at home with my parents. Four years later, I'm now married to a fellow child-free man. I did a 180 in careers and went from working with kids to working in the adult industry (yet another reason I'm so grateful we don't have kids). We get to sleep in however late we want, spend our time and money on whatever we want, have sex whenever we want, be as vulgar and as inappropriate as we want, and NEVER have to worry about me accidentally getting pregnant. The freedom I've gotten from getting sterilized has been one of the biggest gifts in my life. All that ""you'll change your mind"" crap was just that: crap. In fact, the only way I've ""changed my mind"" is that I actually hate kids MORE now than I did at the time of me getting sterilized and have even less tolerance for them than I've had before. Whatever ""maternal extincts"" I thought I had for kids I've realized is better suited for animals. I'm more than happy to be an aunt, a sister, a daughter, and a wife, but ""mother"" is not a role I want or will ever add to my resume.

Any female CFers with a Tubal ligation get depression afterwards?,"Hello.  I have already talked with my doctor about Essure, and she has scheduled my pre-op for May. 

First off, i just want to say how absolutely ecstatic I am that everything is becoming official in regards to becoming sterilized! However, there's one little problem:

You see, although the pre op I have scheduled is for the Essure, in all honesty the procedure that seems more medically appealing to me is getting my tubes tied. 

The only reason why I chose Essure instead was because I had heard that certain women get depression after tubals. And don't quote me on this, but I want to say I read that the reasoning was supposedly because certain hormones become blocked off when you get it done. 

However, when I spoke with my female doctor about this she said that the depression side effect for ladies getting tubals is extremely rare. 

The reason that I am particularly worried about this is because not only have I had some... Issues... In the past, but I also went onto a birth control once that screwed me up so bad that I went into a genuine nervous breakdown. 

Therefore, I was wondering if any of y'all who have had tubals done can touch on this topic in regards to whether or not you became depressed afterwards? And also, if you don't mind, maybe share if you're more prone to getting depressed than others (maybe from family history, your own history, volatile environment, etc.)? You don't have to share why you may or may not be prone...  I was just hoping maybe one of y'all could say ""I got a Tubal. I'm prone to depression, however I did not get depressed afterwards."" as an example. 

But all in all, any insight into this will help.

"A little ranting, and a little good news.","Yesterday we held a bake sale at my work. Now, I work in a video store, people are generally not the best at keeping their eyes on their kids. I've had to pick up and realphabetize entire racks that kids knock over. I've damaged out hundreds of dollars worth of candy kids tear open when their parents aren't looking (or that they just chew on through the wrapper), and scolded many kids running near the unstable shelves, or that come behind the counter. Yesterday the bake sale we were hosting was to raise money for a homeless drive happening at many businesses in my area. Kids kept just grabbing and trying to eat items off the table that their parents weren't planning on paying for. I had to tell a woman that if her child opened a package, I would be charging her for the item. She got so angry with me.
Another woman kept allowing her son to come up behind the counter and stand next to me. I told him he couldnt be there, and had to get down. After I said something to him, his mom said 'get down from there'. Then went back to ignoring him (even though she was standing right next to him, and they were already helped and just standing their blocking the exit. She wasnt talking to anyone or anything, just standing in the way.) He came back behind the counter several more times, each time the mother did nothing about it until I told him to get out.

6/25/2014 will now be known as Freedom Day in our household!,"My fiancé got his vasectomy performed this morning. We are both completely thrilled about this. He was supposed to get it a few months ago, but things came up with his job, so he had to push it back. Well, it finally happened this morning! They are going to test his semen in a month or two to make sure he is completely sterile, and then we are home-free! :) 

He is in a lot of pain right now - he has never had surgery of any sort, never broken a bone, etc, so his pain tolerance is essentially 0, and they only gave him a prescription for Naproxen... so naturally, he's been substituting with some bourbon every now and then. ;) Haha. 

The next thing we plan to do is save up money for the trip to the only city in our state that has a doctor who will give a woman Essure regardless of her age or how many children (if any) that she has. Even though he has a vasectomy, you can really never be too careful, and with my periods being as wonky as they are, I would really like the extra assurance that there will be no babies in my immediate or extended future.

I love that I found this community. For years, I thought I was the weird one - all of my friends wanted kids, everyone I went to school with wanted kids, etc. But since I know there is an entire group for us now.. I don't feel so weird. Thank you all for your stories, occasional giggle-fits, rants, and lastly, for being your lovely selves!

[RANT] I just want my tubes tied!,"To start, I have a whole bunch of genetic problems that have lead me to the responsible decision to not have children of my own to avoid passing those down. That being said, I never wanted children. They are gross and annoying; I have better shit to do with my life.


I went to the doctor for the flu the other day and was told I have high blood pressure. Nothing new to me as this has been going on for a while although I am fit and eat healthy. This particular doctor was very concerned with my blood pressure and told me it is probably from my birth control pill(great another side effect).


I have had my fair share of side effects from these glorious pills and can hardly find a system that works for me. Now that I have, it still causes me anxiety and depression on a lesser scale than others and high blood pressure apparently, I am being told to get off of it from one doctor. This would be no problem except I have been on everything and tried everything! She just said well we can just add blood pressure medicine to your routine now! Great another fucking pill. These pills can cause depression and anxiety, so more pills there too. I learned about essure when I had my mirena placed(caused infections) a few years ago and thought ""wow that would be great!""


I have known for about three years that I wanted my tubes tied, I am 21. My doctor is telling me that I will regret it later in life and won't do it for me. She said to continue on all these pills, even though they are causing harm to my body, because my reproductive system is too important. For some reason the rest of my body just is not as important as my damn vagina and accessories.  


I have every reason to not want children of my own or any at all! Why can I not make my own decision on this? I just want to be happy and healthy and birth control pills are making that hard. I don't think it is right to just use condoms and nothing else and subject myself to an inevitable abortion later since they will fail at some point. That is not a risk I am willing to take. I just want what I want, for a responsible reason. I may be young but I know what is right for my body for the long term and getting my tubes tied would solve quite a few problems in my life and my future.

Scared for my reproductive rights.,"After looking at the results of the election last night,  I'm more than a little worried about an onslaught of pro-life legislation being pushed through in the future.  I believe it's only a matter of time before they start attacking abortion across the country,  and I have nightmares about having a cryptic pregnancy or finding out too late,  or getting pregnant and having all the nearby clinics closed.  I'm going to have to find a CF friendly gynecologist in the Salt Lake City area to either give me a Paragard, Essure, or a tubal. Anyone else going to scramble to get appointments set, or is it just me? 

It's bad enough that there's only a vasectomy doc listed in my area in the sidebar... Any other CF ladies out here that have doctors to avoid/not bother with?  I don't want to waste my time.

I wish people would stop breeding.,"An old co-worker keeping the baby, after they have 4 kids in the house, 2 already sharing a room, they have a tiny house. She's the only one that works, her fiancee is disabled. It's a completely unfair situation for everyone involved.

I've mentioned the baby that was being abused. She came home (the state I'm currently in) to be with her dad for a week. It's worse than I thought. Where she lived (with her mom), they refused to feed her, they didn't bathe her, and the baby says that her mom hits her. **A lot**. I still don't have enough information to go to CPS, my mom still won't make the call, hoping the school system will notice, and a teacher will make a call (yea, right!). The baby has already gone back home. And, the mom's family is full of gangsters, one of whom killed 12 people, and was let back out after 5 years in jail (I wish I was exaggerating or killing), but he's in this state (breaking his parole), and my mom, for the fear of her own safety, **still** won't make an anonymous tip. Even though my dad and I are begging her too. We have loose ties to this gangster, if he finds out where we live, what's to keep him from killing us and robbing everything we have? 

If I were to finally get the info now about CPS, the child might go back to the dad, and if he does. This gangster would likely come to their house, kill everyone, and kidnap the baby. 

But, my parents don't want me to make any permanent decisions about my sterilization, because I'm too young to know the consequences of something that permanent (they don't know about my impending Essure, and I don't feel the need to tell them). We've got enough children on this planet, that are starving every day, we have people fighting for birth control because they know of this issue, but people that don't want it to come out of *their* wallet. Both of these children (the one to be, and the one being abused) were accidents, which just makes me more angry. I wish abortion wasn't so stigmatized. What I'm about to say is probably going to land me in hell, but fuck it, I've got a carriage reserved. The baby being abused shouldn't have ever been born, and this new one coming, should definitely not be born, and I hope she miscarries. I know, I know, witch burning that way -----&gt;

Seriously though, I'm the selfish one here?

[META] We need to talk,"There are some things that need to be addressed, because I am so tired of explaining myself every other day. You know how it clearly says on the side?

### SUBREDDIT RULES: READ RULES BEFORE POSTING!

Yea, the ones I'm defending myself against, I'm tired of doing so. The ones I'm experiencing trouble with are parent lurkers who have come out of the woodwork to unnecessarily berate *all of us* for being child haters. But, I see it happen with Childfree members as well. 

Usually, I would leave this alone, but people are now afraid to just [*joke*](http://imgur.com/n7nEUaf)

So, I think I need to reiterate something I've had to tell to posters, because they won't spend two minutes reading the subreddit rules. To make it simple, I'll just quote directly from the rules

###'Do childfree people dislike children and their parents?

No. Not all childfree people dislike children or their parents. The only hallmark required to be a childfree person is not desiring children. Some childfree people choose to have children play a large role in their lives by pursuing teaching or childcare careers, and some choose to omit children from their lives as much as possible.

###Then why are there frequent posts complaining about them?

Many of us live in a world in which it is socially absolutely unacceptable to criticize any aspect of pregnancy, children, or their parents for any reason. As a result, many of us need a supportive outlet for being able to express our frustration with any of those things. For many of us, r/childfree is our place to vent and express exasperation.""'

What I think a lot of people don't understand, is that, this is the *only* safe place for **many** of us to talk negatively about children. When we do say anything outside of here, we usually get called child-haters, and the implications of that can mean losing friends, being branded as a monster, or being berated and shunned into silence. Saying anything negative in the real world, heck, most parts of the internet even, is a good way to get reprimanded. 

If we want to gush about children, we can go *anywhere*. And the [people](http://imgur.com/BzjAr1j)^[1]  [who](http://imgur.com/LskGSRO)^[2] [like](http://imgur.com/zlOh1Px)^[3]  [kids](http://imgur.com/uSc6BH4)^[4]    [get](http://imgur.com/jgEY9zE)^[5] [this](http://imgur.com/DQSiJn0)^[6]. 

If you don't believe me on the anywhere? There's plenty of places on reddit for those who like children.

/r/Parenting

/r/cutekids

/r/newparents

/r/cutebabies

That was just through a few minutes of searching, I'm sure if I dug deeper I could find loads more, and that's just on reddit! Personally, as I'm living with my parents(moving out soon, but that's a different story), I can't tell my parents.  They won't even believe my decision is serious. They'll tell me that I'm too young to know my own mind, my dad will say I'm disobeying a commandment from God(not taking a second to think about the fact that I'm atheist). This is the only safe place I can go to rant. I am not around kids a lot in my day to day life, but in case I come across some miniature human that's insufferable, I have a safe place to share my frustration with others.


One point that seems to be floating around is. ""For people who don't want kids, you talk about them a lot.""

For that, I give thanks to /u/voteforabetterpotato for this perfect analogy.

""I told a colleague about my vasectomy over lunch and how I'm happily childfree. She told me ""Are you sure you're not in denial? Because for someone who doesn't want kids, you sure talk about it often"". I came up with a good analogy: I asked her if she likes blue cheese. She said no.

So I said, imagine if everyone on earth loved blue cheese except you. It was all over Facebook. It's all people ever talked about. Family functions were hours of people talking about blue cheese and how you're just telling yourself that you don't like blue cheese, but you'll change your mind and that everyone wants blue cheese poured over everything eventually.

Wouldn't that make you anti-blue cheese? So against the idea of blue cheese everywhere that you'd vent about it with friends at every opportunity?""

This concept is especially true if you've never been fond of blue cheese, you struggled trying to figure out if blue cheese was for you or not, and got flack from anyone you voiced your concerns to. Blue cheese in this scenario being children of course.

I would just like to wrap up with one more thing, this has been hitting home, as I'm one of the ""younger"" ones on the sub. I'm 20 years old. From what I've seen, a lot of new members coming to this reddit are my age, and a 21 year old female just got approved for Essure. Before, I continue, I would like to refer to something on the rules once more.

###'Won’t you guys change your minds in the future?

Some of us may, some of us won’t. While people are certainly welcome to come to this forum for support and discussion of possibly transitioning into identifying as childfree or pursuing parenthood, it is inappropriate to presume that any person is incapable of making their own decisions. Therefore, telling someone that you’re sure they’ll change their mind about kids when they hit 30 or “meet the right person”, etc. is entirely rude and inappropriate.'

Especially on the younger sterilization posts I've seen posts such as. ""Since you're young, I can understand why they said no/laughed at you/interrogated you/insisted something is wrong with you/ because you might change your mind in the future.""

This may be trying to pass it off as playing Devil's advocate, but this is nothing more than a BINGO. You are essentially saying ""You're too young to know what you want, the Doctor made the right decision."" You can have those opinions all you want, but we ask that you keep them off this board. Not only is this a safe place for many of us to rant about kids.

It's a safe place for to say ""I like kids, but I get branded as child hater anyway.""

It's a safe place to talk about sterilization despite any age.

It's a safe place to talk about the abortion we're going through, or our partner is going through.

It's a safe place to figure out what we want in our lives.

It's a safe place to talk about our partners who did change their minds.

It's a safe place to talk about how we might change our minds

^* Also a safe place to say this freely without responses such as ""I was right! I knew you'd change your mind, kids are the only way to be happy.""

It's a safe place to talk freely about our fear of birth and pregnancy(see: tokophobia).

It's a safe place to talk about pregnancy and birth from the perspective of people who physically can't go through it.

You know how it clearly says on the side?

### SUBREDDIT RULES: READ RULES BEFORE POSTING!

Yea, the ones I'm defending myself against, I'm tired of doing so. The ones I'm experiencing trouble with are parent lurkers who have come out of the woodwork to unnecessarily berate *all of us* for being child haters. But, I see it happen with Childfree members as well. 

Usually, I would leave this alone, but people are now afraid to just [*joke*](http://imgur.com/n7nEUaf)

So, I think I need to reiterate something I've had to tell to posters, because they won't spend two minutes reading the subreddit rules. To make it simple, I'll just quote directly from the rules

###'Do childfree people dislike children and their parents?

No. Not all childfree people dislike children or their parents. The only hallmark required to be a childfree person is not desiring children. Some childfree people choose to have children play a large role in their lives by pursuing teaching or childcare careers, and some choose to omit children from their lives as much as possible.

###Then why are there frequent posts complaining about them?

Many of us live in a world in which it is socially absolutely unacceptable to criticize any aspect of pregnancy, children, or their parents for any reason. As a result, many of us need a supportive outlet for being able to express our frustration with any of those things. For many of us, r/childfree is our place to vent and express exasperation.""'

What I think a lot of people don't understand, is that, this is the *only* safe place for **many** of us to talk negatively about children. When we do say anything outside of here, we usually get called child-haters, and the implications of that can mean losing friends, being branded as a monster, or being berated and shunned into silence. Saying anything negative in the real world, heck, most parts of the internet even, is a good way to get reprimanded. 

If we want to gush about children, we can go *anywhere*. And the [people](http://imgur.com/BzjAr1j)^[1]  [who](http://imgur.com/LskGSRO)^[2] [like](http://imgur.com/zlOh1Px)^[3]  [kids](http://imgur.com/uSc6BH4)^[4]    [get](http://imgur.com/jgEY9zE)^[5] [this](http://imgur.com/DQSiJn0)^[6]. 

If you don't believe me on the anywhere? There's plenty of places on reddit for those who like children.

/r/Parenting

/r/cutekids

/r/newparents

/r/cutebabies

That was just through a few minutes of searching, I'm sure if I dug deeper I could find loads more, and that's just on reddit! Personally, as I'm living with my parents(moving out soon, but that's a different story), I can't tell my parents.  They won't even believe my decision is serious. They'll tell me that I'm too young to know my own mind, my dad will say I'm disobeying a commandment from God(not taking a second to think about the fact that I'm atheist). This is the only safe place I can go to rant. I am not around kids a lot in my day to day life, but in case I come across some miniature human that's insufferable, I have a safe place to share my frustration with others.


One point that seems to be floating around is. ""For people who don't want kids, you talk about them a lot.""

For that, I give thanks to /u/voteforabetterpotato for this perfect analogy.

""I told a colleague about my vasectomy over lunch and how I'm happily childfree. She told me ""Are you sure you're not in denial? Because for someone who doesn't want kids, you sure talk about it often"". I came up with a good analogy: I asked her if she likes blue cheese. She said no.

So I said, imagine if everyone on earth loved blue cheese except you. It was all over Facebook. It's all people ever talked about. Family functions were hours of people talking about blue cheese and how you're just telling yourself that you don't like blue cheese, but you'll change your mind and that everyone wants blue cheese poured over everything eventually.

Wouldn't that make you anti-blue cheese? So against the idea of blue cheese everywhere that you'd vent about it with friends at every opportunity?""

This concept is especially true if you've never been fond of blue cheese, you struggled trying to figure out if blue cheese was for you or not, and got flack from anyone you voiced your concerns to. Blue cheese in this scenario being children of course.

I would just like to wrap up with one more thing, this has been hitting home, as I'm one of the ""younger"" ones on the sub. I'm 20 years old. From what I've seen, a lot of new members coming to this reddit are my age, and a 21 year old female just got approved for Essure. Before, I continue, I would like to refer to something on the rules once more.

###'Won’t you guys change your minds in the future?

Some of us may, some of us won’t. While people are certainly welcome to come to this forum for support and discussion of possibly transitioning into identifying as childfree or pursuing parenthood, it is inappropriate to presume that any person is incapable of making their own decisions. Therefore, telling someone that you’re sure they’ll change their mind about kids when they hit 30 or “meet the right person”, etc. is entirely rude and inappropriate.'

Especially on the younger sterilization posts I've seen posts such as. ""Since you're young, I can understand why they said no/laughed at you/interrogated you/insisted something is wrong with you/ because you might change your mind in the future.""

This may be trying to pass it off as playing Devil's advocate, but this is nothing more than a BINGO. You are essentially saying ""You're too young to know what you want, the Doctor made the right decision."" You can have those opinions all you want, but we ask that you keep them off this board. Not only is this a safe place for many of us to rant about kids.

It's a safe place for to say ""I like kids, but I get branded as child hater anyway.""

It's a safe place to talk about sterilization despite any age.

It's a safe place to talk about the abortion we're going through, or our partner is going through.

It's a safe place to figure out what we want in our lives.

It's a safe place to talk about our partners who did change their minds.

It's a safe place to talk about how we might change our minds

^* Also a safe place to say this freely without responses such as ""I was right! I knew you'd change your mind, kids are the only way to be happy.""

It's a safe place to talk freely about our fear of birth and pregnancy(see: tokophobia).

It's a safe place to talk about pregnancy and birth from the perspective of people who physically can't go through it.

^* And much more

So, can we all take a step back, take a deep breath? There is not one specific type of person in Childfree. I love this sub, it's a safe place for me as well as many others, and I don't want that to be taken away from us. Alright, bring it in, let's hug it out. *Internet hugs*

Australian ladies ... I have some questions about getting fixed. Help?,"Hello lovely ladies of CF! I am looking for your help. I am trying to research into getting fixed and I am honestly stumped and feeling somewhat overwhelmed. A lot of threads here are for people based in the US, so figured I'd just ask.

For ladies that have been/are currently going through this...

*- Are you using private health insurance/going through Medicare?*

I'm from the UK am kind of fuzzy with Aussie healthcare works. Other than going bulk billed GP appointments for getting my pill I have never used the healthcare system. Does Medicare even cover it? If I need insurance can I take it out knowing full well I only want it for the procedure?

*- How did you go about finding a doctor?* 

Did you go to your GP initially? A women's health clinic? Straight up tried to find a doctor who would do the procedure? I really don't feel comfortable speaking to my current GP - whenever I need a new prescription he just asks if I've had any problems, then signs a prescription. It takes longer to book the appointment than the actual appointment lasts. 

*- The method of sterilisation*

Literally everywhere I have read only mentions tubal litigation or Essure. I want a bilateral salpingectomy but I can't read anywhere that doctors will do it. 

Thanks in advance! My hunt for the fix will begin properly in the new year when I'm back from my holiday, and I will probably have more questions but want to get some basic research out of the way :)

Childfreedom: a spectacular relief. A garbled relief rant,"I've been CF since I heard having children was a choice. I went for an Essure over a week ago [it was fantastic. I LOVE it!] Unfortunately, I only have one coil, the gyno was unable to find my other fallopian tube. He estimated I'd either have a bicornuate uterus or I could have been born with only one tube.

I had an ultrasound today which confirmed I have 2 uteri. It's fairly rare, but causes massive problems with pregnancy- a lot of miscarriages, uterus ruption, kidney problems and urinary problems. 

Being CF is a relief, many women with a wonky uterus like mine go through hell with pregnancy and have ended up needing hysterectomies. Not only did I dodge the traditional problems with having kids, I've also dodged having fucked up health and heartbreak.

My mum is freaked out. Previously she supported my CFdom, but now she's relieved I'm CF and both my parents are 100 % pro me being CF.

Well that was easy,"I just left my pre-op consultation for Essure. I'm 25, not married, don't have kids and don't want them. I had heard the horror stories that some had gone through in their journey to sterilization so a few months ago when I decided to talk to my doctor about essure I was nervous.

My doctor did ask ""Are you sure? and ""You know that is permanent"" her concern didn't seem to stem from thinking I didn't know what I wanted but more from her wanting to cover her bases. She told me she had a woman the previous month become very upset because she (a mother of 3) had the procedure then regretted it and she just wanted to make sure I knew everything about my options. I believe her because as soon as I said ""Yes I'm sure"" she was writing my referral. 

Fast foward one month I'm sitting at my new doctors office nervous as all get out. I had all my arguments ready but didn't need them. My doctor walked in and said,"" You know this is permanent?""

""Yes I do""

""So then I guess my only question is do you want children?""

""Nope""

""Great let's get you set up.""

Careful optimism,"Went to the GP's office today to get a prescription refilled and asked him about sterilization; specifically I asked if there's a weight limit I should be under to be sterilized, I've been ill for months last year and regained a lot of weight I previously lost. I'm back on track on losing weight, but I just wanted to know if there was a specific weight limit I should keep in mind before going to the ob/gyn. 

He just gave me a referral straight away, only asking about my previous one a few years back; that ob/gyn refused because ""30% changes their mind!"" I told him ""I like them odds!"" but he refused. 

My current ob/gyn also helps trans* people, so I'm carefully optimistic he'll respect my decision as an adult woman. And hopefully he'll go along with surgical sterilization rather than Essure or something because it seems that technique [has some issues](http://www.nbcnews.com/health/womens-health/essure-sterilization-device-causes-serious-safety-concern-study-n443966).

Please help me choose a birth control amid fear/anxiety over side effects!,"Vehemently child-free married 25F here. I got married almost a year ago, and have been deployed for six months of that. I haven't been on any birth control for this time. Now I'm about to come home, and I need to decide on a birth control!

Before I left, I was on the Nuvaring, and my experience was (mostly positive) and very easy to keep up with. The side-effects I experienced, however, were easier weight gain, slightly lower libido, and stretch marks. (I can't prove the stretch marks came from the NuvaRing, but the last time I developed stretch marks I was a growing teenager, within 6 months on the Nuvaring, I developed awful stretch marks on my breasts, stomach, hips, even under my arm pit!)

Before that, the only other hormonal birth control I had tried was ""the pill"" but I could not, for the life of me, take it at the same time or even remember it everyday. My moods were all over the place, and it was clearly ineffective the way I was taking it.

Now, I'm looking at other methods, and no matter what I'm looking at, I look at the side effects and just cringe. I'm scared of all hormonal birthcontrol now. I would never consider the shot, and I am hesistant about the implant.

I've thought about an IUD, but again, hormonal. Or I could go with the copper, but horror stories about heavy periods, pain of insertion, possible migration is all really freaking me out.

So... sterilization! Maybe essure? But what if I develop a nickel allergy while it's inside me!? Tubal ligation? But then I hear about tubal ligation syndrome!? Which apparently definitely IS or IS NOT a thing depending on where you look.

The rhythm method? I am totally body unaware. I can't even take a pill everyday. Am I seriously going to be able to take my temperature, and realize I'm ovulating on any given day?

I just got married and now I'm terrified that the only way I can avoid being pregnant is no sex forever! And before you ask why my husband doesn't get a vasectomy, he has testicular cysts, which we are afraid may complicate things, and secondly, I am the adamently CF one. He is more like a converted fence-sitter. If I was to ever die or something, I would want him to be able to have kids if he decided he wanted to.

I know the only answer, in the end, is to talk to my doctor, pick one, try it out, and deal with the risks/side effects should there be any, but I just don't even know what to do.

Now, I'm looking at other methods, and no matter what I'm looking at, I look at the side effects and just cringe. I'm scared of all hormonal birthcontrol now. I would never consider the shot, and I am hesistant about the implant.

I've thought about an IUD, but again, hormonal. Or I could go with the copper, but horror stories about heavy periods, pain of insertion, possible migration is all really freaking me out.

So... sterilization! Maybe essure? But what if I develop a nickel allergy while it's inside me!? Tubal ligation? But then I hear about tubal ligation syndrome!? Which apparently definitely IS or IS NOT a thing depending on where you look.

The rhythm method? I am totally body unaware. I can't even take a pill everyday. Am I seriously going to be able to take my temperature, and realize I'm ovulating on any given day?

I just got married and now I'm terrified that the only way I can avoid being pregnant is no sex forever! And before you ask why my husband doesn't get a vasectomy, he has testicular cysts, which we are afraid may complicate things, and secondly, I am the adamently CF one. He is more like a converted fence-sitter. If I was to ever die or something, I would want him to be able to have kids if he decided he wanted to.

I know the only answer, in the end, is to talk to my doctor, pick one, try it out, and deal with the risks/side effects should there be any, but I just don't even know what to do.

Just Got My Essure! [RAVE],"Hello! 25 &amp; married, just got my Essure done today. I'm about 11 hours post-procedure. Feel amazing! Cramps have gone away, virtually no pain. Just a bit of bloating in the stomach (assume it's from swelling) and a general feeling of not being able to get quite comfortable. Because my job is so physically intense, I've been told to take the rest of the week off and take it easy when I get back until I feel 100% again. Otherwise I would have been cleared for normal activities by tomorrow.

Procedure went well. They originally tried to do it in-office but I was unable to handle it (the details are personal and not directly related to the procedure). They then scheduled me for sedation. I've never been sedated before. Long story short, sedation was fine and I was out really quickly. Very minor complication that required me to get an oxygen tube in my nose but the anesthesiologist kindly placed it behind my septum piercing so he didn't have to take the piercing out.

I'm not quite up to providing moment-by-moment info but I promise I will later. I'll either edit this or comment. Just still dealing with tiring after effects of severe anxiety. Again, nothing to do with the procedure itself.

I am answering questions and will answer all (reasonable) questions as quickly as possible. PLEASE feel free! I am not shy. No question too personal. Have at it!

TL;DR: Essure was placed, procedure was great, sedation happened, ask me any and all questions.",childfree,2017-07-13 01:34:28,hello amp married got done today hour feel amazing cramp gone away virtually pain bit bloating stomach assume swelling general feeling able comfortable job physically intense told take rest week take easy back feel otherwise cleared normal activity tomorrow procedure went well originally tried unable handle detail personal directly related procedure scheduled sedation never sedated long story short sedation fine really quickly minor complication required oxygen tube nose anesthesiologist kindly placed behind septum piercing take piercing providing info promise later either edit comment still dealing tiring effect severe anxiety nothing procedure answering question answer reasonable question quickly possible please feel free shy question personal tl dr placed procedure great sedation happened ask question,got rave,"Just Got My Essure!

Response to my doctor’s bingo that helped me get sterilized,"New to the posting on reddit thing (been lurking for a while) so I hope I’m doing this right. I can be a little longwinded so I put a TLDR at the bottom for those who don’t want to read my whole novel :)

I managed to find a doctor in a conservative part of the country and get sterilized this past December. What I said isn’t something I’ve run across personally in this subreddit (not saying it isn’t here somewhere) as advice for what to say to your doctor so I wanted to share in the hopes of helping other ladies out. 

I’d been asking at annual appointments since turning 18 and always got bingoed and noped by the doctor of the year. Last year I had two periods out of whack, VERY unusual for me, and decided to get checked out. I knew if I went in for this to any of the gynecologists I had been to previous years they would just say “oh you need to be on birth control to be regular” and not really look into what was going on deeper. Friend recommended a different doctor and I made an appontment. At the end of that evaluation/annual she asked about other questions I had, per my yearly routine I brought up sterilization. 

She immediately bingoed me (you’re single, what if you meet Mr. Perfect in a few years and he won’t marry you unless you have kids?), to which I laughed hysterically and said then he clearly isn’t my “Mr. Perfect”. 

I’ve been going through these discussions for ten years, so instead of being reserved and polite, after that comment I immediately launched into a mini-rant: “Listen, I am a 28 year old woman. If I came in here today and told you I wanted to have a baby I KNOW you would have no problem helping me with that. I have been asking for sterilization for ten years because I do not ever want to be pregnant ever, why don’t you help me with that? If the other doctors at this clinic have been doing their jobs properly you should be able to look at my chart notes from previous visits to verify this.” 

She didn’t have any words after that, and I could tell I had hit some sort of thinking bone, so I took her silence as an opportunity to share more. I told her I have the discussion with potential partners about kids on or before a first date, and that the fact I was single was a positive and meant I was obviously making this decision about my own body myself, not under coercion...and briefly told her my BC history: can’t even remember to take my other medications daily let alone at the same time=pill not an option, been on depo and it sucked, nuva ring sucked, hormones-even low/localized dose-make me bat shit crazy so no arm implant or plastic IUD, allergic to nickel so copper IUD and Essure not an option, would have gladly gotten Adiana (silicone version of Essure) but no doctor would sterilize me before the supply ran out (since the essure assholes sued them for patent infringement they had to stop producing them because of said lawsuit). Told her Adiana was what I really wanted, because of my fear of anesthesia, but I was finally accepting no clinic in the country had any supply left at this point, and a surgery with anesthesia was going to be my only option unless/until something new came around. 

She took more thinking silence, then said she wasn’t comfortable saying yes, first time she’d ever seen me, if I wanted to come back in a month or two we could talk about it more. Left the appointment, booked a followup with low expectations, this is conservative land after all, and came back in several weeks. I was ready to come in swinging and have to defend my decision more, even refused to pay my copay at check in, told them I’d pay it on my way out if the appt went well.

Nurse called me back, doing vitals and all that she asked when I wanted to have surgery done. We started talking about dates, I was shocked but still skeptical this was actually happening considering 10 years of personal experience. Then the doctor came in, smiled and said “you came back!” She immediately launched into discussion about my choices for the actual procedure, all the in and outs of the surgery prep and day, and confirmed the date I picked with the nurse. Not one bingo! She did cover as part of the consent form I had to sign that I knew these were irreversible procedures, the BS which I had chosen especially so. 

I asked her at the end if she had looked at my chart from previous years and she said “Nope. You clearly know kids aren’t for you, and were very well educated on all your options. And you are right, it is ultimately your choice to make, not mine, or anyone else’s.”

No essure for me...,"I'm 34, in the Netherlands, having some physical problems caused by the estrogen hormones from the NuvaRing (and the ones my body produces aren't helping either, I guess). I hadn't met the gynaecologist lady who saw me today, but when I proposed permanent sterilisation instead, telling her both I and the boyfriend are not wanting to have kids ever, she said she wouldn't do it. Seen too many people regret it, she said. After test results on my bloody fragile cervix come back clean, I will get a Mirena instead.

(They had a poster saying ""Is your family complete? Then Essure is a great birth control method!"").

Good thing about the Mirena is that my menstruations aren't very nice, so hopefully the Mirena gives me 4-5 years of no menstruations. And with two or three of them in a row I should reach the blisfull age where pregnancy becomes impossible.
