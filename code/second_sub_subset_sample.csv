Question for sterilized ladies,"Hello you beautiful bunch!

I've been researching some permanent birth control solutions. I've been taking the pill religiously for 10 years now (25F), and it's been great so far, but I'm thinking ahead :)

So my question is: after, say, a salpingectomy, is it possible/not too risky to keep using a contraceptive pill, as it keeps my (otherwise chaotic) hormonal balance in check?

I know that the pill stops me from ovulating, but there is that teeny tiny failure rate that scares me into thinking seriously about getting snipped. 

Sorry if this doesn't belong in this sub, but I figured I might ask first-hand witnesses, and besides google didn't return anything relevant, no matter how I twisted the keywords around :/ (no, I'm not interested in getting pregnant after essure, bad google! :p)

"How do I ""trust"" my tubal?","So one of the reasons I got a tubal back in October was pretty bad anxiety regarding getting pregnant. I ultimately wanted a full BS, but alas I had to settle for a cut n burn, three cuts on each side. According to the surgeon, everything went routinely and smoothly. And I was happy and calm. Yay. 

But now, despite the tubal, I am feeling anxious again because, well, I have no way of checking it. I previously had paragard, and while it wasn't ideal and also caused anxiety, I could still check the string (kind of). I recently got into a new relationship and we've had unprotected sex, and now I'm slightly worried. How do I know I'm protected? How can I learn to trust my tubal?

I know this is irrational. My period isn't even due for a couple of days. What are stats regarding triple cut tubals? All the ""tubal"" stats I can find seem to include essure/clips/single cut stats. And yes, before anyone suggests it, I do see a therapist for my anxiety.

Edit: while yes, I would have an abortion, I'm worried also because it would likely be ectopic. Can you have pill abortions with ectopic pregnancies?

Edit 2: and what exactly happens to the egg, since it doesn't pass though? Does it just chill there in the tube nub for the rest of my life?

I am in love with my new primary care physician. One more doc for the list!,"This past year I got off of my parents insurance and onto my own. Basically I've been dreading my check up with the new doctor due to all of the horror stories here about jerk-off physicians.

The whole time leading up to the check-up I have been stressing about about the check-up. Not that all docs are like this, but I hate when they don't listen and don't take you seriously. Like, they'll be polite but you can tell they don't really believe you. So all yesterday and this morning I'm rehearsing all the possible ways my inquiry into a tubal could go. I was getting ready for a fight, to have to be aggressive about it i.e. ""does patient autonomy ring a bell? It should.""

So we're going over my history and plethora of allergies when we get to the ""Are you on any meds? Not even birth control?"" part and it went like this: 
&gt;Me: No, I'm not currently sexually active and I've had a lot of bad side effects from BC in the past... Um, well I know it's a little unusual for someone my age but I'm really interested in a tubal.

&gt;Doc: Oh okay, well if you know that that is something you want that's great I can set up a referral for the GYN/OB office downstairs. They'd call you in about a week to get you set up and started on that. Have you thought about essure though? It's a little less invasive.

&gt;Me: Yes but with all my allergies I'd be afraid to react to the metal. (I have a severe gold allergy, not kidding. While I haven't reacted to nickel-titanium to my knowledge it was not included in my last allergy panel tests and I wouldn't want to find out about *another* allergy after it's implanted)

&gt;Doc: ohhh yeah, that would definitely be a concern. But yeah, I'll give you a referral for them!

That. was. it. I'm shocked to say the least but in the best way possible. I'm 25F and the area where I live is very conservative and religious in some ways so I was thinking it would be a uphill battle. A co-worker of mine had mentioned her married friends with 2 kids wanted sterilization and kept getting rejected because they ""might want more later"". 

I'm adding the doc to the CF-friendly list. She's amazing. I still have the GYN/OB office visit to go but with my PCP behind me it should be fine! I wish everyone here could have the luck I've had today.

(She also prescribed me an epi-pen! I've been fighting to get one prescribed for the past 2 years due to a bad reaction to a bee sting.

I'd like to help clarify a common misconception about sterilization I see all over this sub.,"I see this misconception to the point it irritates me. This simple knowledge is along the lines of stuff I thought they teach in high school biology/sex ed so I just want to help clarify for those who seem confused. This is more aimed toward those on the fence about tubal sterilization.

""Permanent"" tubal sterilization procedures (ligation/coagulation/essure) ≠ no biological children with your own DNA ever, if hypothetically you were to happen to change your mind way in the future sometime. Yes even the absolutely physically irreversible coagulation method. The only thing that would actually prevent that would be something like a hysterectomy or oophorectomy. With tubal sterilization, you still have your own eggs, in other words. It just means you can't get pregnant the *natural* way.

That said, you could still later on change your mind and use your eggs with methods like IVF or a surrogate and have a child that is biologically your own. And this in a way is a good thing because considering the cost of it, by the point in your life that you have that sort of money to spend on such a thing you know you are financially stable enough to afford a kid. Or, don't have a kid, maybe you'll decide you won't change your mind after all.

So if you have any doubt in your mind about wanting kids for a very long time if not ever, the surgery is a very good option for you and you have nothing to be afraid of. They only use the terminology ""permanent"" to scare you because they like to encourage people to be more likely increase the population due to it being profitable or whatever.",childfree,2013-07-23 23:43:28,see misconception point irritates simple knowledge along line stuff thought teach high school ed want help clarify seem confused aimed toward fence tubal sterilization permanent tubal sterilization procedure biological child dna ever hypothetically happen change mind way future sometime yes even absolutely physically irreversible coagulation method thing actually prevent something like hysterectomy oophorectomy tubal sterilization still egg word mean ca pregnant natural way said still later change mind use egg method like ivf surrogate child biologically way good thing considering cost point life sort money spend thing know financially stable enough afford kid kid maybe decide wo change mind doubt mind wanting kid long time ever surgery good option nothing afraid use terminology permanent scare like encourage people likely increase population due profitable whatever,like help clarify common misconception sterilization see sub,"I'd like to help clarify a common misconception about sterilization I see all over this sub.

My doctor brought up tubal ligation before I did - and I'm only 24 and live in the conservative southern US!,"I've had the Nexplanon implant for 2.5 years now, nearly at its 3-year stated lifespan. I suspect it could be having negative effects on me, so I'm just done with it and any other hormonal method. I've had a lower libido if nothing else, but I've also had low energy and general weirdness for a couple years now which could also be related.


So, I picked a doctor from the list on the sidebar, who happened to be right in my small, conservative city in the southern US.


The first meeting with the doctor (while dressed and in his office!), I mentioned wanting something long-term and asked about Essure. I discovered he doesn't do it anymore due to legal pushback despite never having any issues with his previous patients.

I was...not prepared for this answer. I could have sworn I even asked about it on the phone.


At this point, I started panicking a little because I wasn't very assertive. I came in expecting to plead my case for Essure, not possibly have to ask for a tubal ligation--which seems like a much bigger deal to get approved for! I admit...I wasn't prepared, and the news about Essure threw me off that much more. I hesitantly agreed to look at the brochure for the 5 year IUD he suggested.


Then I went into the exam room, got undressed, etc. He came in and said that since I seem sure of not ever wanting kids, that I could consider a tubal ligation! My deer-in-the-headlights moment while in shock may have come across as lack of enthusiasm because he suggested I can think about it and call back--which prompted me to assure him I was *definitely* interested. 

So...it's scheduled for a month from now! I'm a little nervous, especially since my boyfriend is out of town that week, but there's not really a better day available that works with his schedule unless I wait several months. I'm really anxious to get the implant taken out and start heading in the right direction as far as my libido/fatigue/motivation issues. The implant is the next step on the list to check. I have a roommate and several friends in the area, so I should be ok. One of my friends even graciously offered to cancel his weekend plans out of town if I needed someone around.

Childfree as long as I can remember,"I am primarily a spectator of the Childfree subreddit because it brings me much comfort that I am not alone in this world where I feel like I'm the only one to choose the childfree lifestyle. I don't usually engage with other posts since I don't visit this forum as often.

So a little about why I am childfree... When I see little kids or babies, I don't get the ""aww he/she is sooo cute"" feelings, ever. I confirmed my childfree lifestyle a few years ago, but I would be kidding myself if I did not highlight the one event when I was around 7 or 8 years old when I was told to be nice to my friend because ""one day I will have kids and you will have to share"". And that's where a lot of the shitty commentary begins. How does a 7 year old kid comprehend that kind of conversation? I was hanging out with a friend and did not want to share my snack. Yes, that might sound ridiculous that I remember that specific event, but I think that was the very first event in my life (that I can recall) where I had no desire for children. Obviously, I wasn't bothered by that one event growing up, but when/if anyone asks me how long I've known then I say since I was very young. What about now? Well I'm  23 years of age and figuring out my path to happiness in life. I can tell anyone with a ton of confidence that children and having a family is not part of my life plans. Families can consist of two people - a woman and a man (pets are optional of course, but count towards that as well). Unfortunately, that is not very accepted by cultural tradition. Fuck tradition. We live in the 21st century, where technology is progressing exponentially and society has failed to keep up. The statistics cannot be denied that more women are either delaying reproduction or foregoing it completely to have a fulfilled life on their own terms. There is nothing about motherhood that makes a woman complete. We have reproductive organs that we can disable if we want (hopefully there will be a solution to disable periods without extremely invasive surgery or hormonal stuff). 

There are a lot of reasons why I'm childfree. I could write an entire essay about it, which I plan to do once I have the time to sit down and write more. But it all boils down to one short explanation: I have no desire and I would be a bad parent. I have ZERO desire. I don't hate kids. I simply have no warm feelings towards them or can relate to them. I never envision spending part of my precious time on Earth raising a child from birth to adulthood. I don't have any desire to spend money, resources, and patience to watch a human grow. Time and financial freedom are some of my top greatest goals right now, therefore raising even one child takes away from that overall. 

I have a vision for my life and that consists of being successful in my career, being able to travel around the world, and make a contribution to the planet, society, and universe before I die. Yes, I want to help people.... I want to help people that ALREADY EXIST. I want to help family and friends as I am able to. I want to be able to donate to charities that resonate with me.... I want to reward myself in my success, yet I am considerate to others that are important to me. 

What about love? Yes, I want to fall in love in my lifetime also, which is my greatest fear when it comes to thinking about being childfree. Having a life partner who cares about you, respects you, supports your crazy ideas, and enjoy life without children almost seems like a fantasy unicorn world. I have an absolutely amazing boyfriend, but I get fearful from time to time. Not going into detail like others have shared on this forum, but my heart goes out to you all who have either suffered heart break or depression because your partner wants to have children unexpectedly. I think the worst part is that there is no compromise for those who have been in a serious relationship for so long. You either have a child or you don't. If you don't then the other person will resent you. If you cave in, then you're going to resent the other and live in agony for 18 years (in the United States at least). 

What have I done to finalize my childfree lifestyle? Well, I haven't.....yet. I am scared to death of tubal litigations, Essure, and even a hysterectomy. I don't have painful periods or cramps. Even if I had the financial resources to permanently disable my reproductive organs, I'm not sure if I'm comfortable with that yet. Non hormonal IUDs seem like the only close-to-perfect option to guard me. Also obviously, a vasectomy is much more cost-effective and less risky. So does that make me less of a childfree person because I haven't made the permanent procedure? I don't think so. Feel free to provide input if you think otherwise.

Anyways, I've been recommended to not read this forum for a while. I'm not sure. I don't visit this site often to being with. I think for me the best thing I can do is not get sad when thinking about my responsible lifestyle choice. I am going to focus on what makes me happy in life and keep progress with all the things I want to accomplish. I don't create bucket lists -- I create life lists.

I don't usually engage with other posts since I don't visit this forum as often.

So a little about why I am childfree... When I see little kids or babies, I don't get the ""aww he/she is sooo cute"" feelings, ever. I confirmed my childfree lifestyle a few years ago, but I would be kidding myself if I did not highlight the one event when I was around 7 or 8 years old when I was told to be nice to my friend because ""one day I will have kids and you will have to share"". And that's where a lot of the shitty commentary begins. How does a 7 year old kid comprehend that kind of conversation? I was hanging out with a friend and did not want to share my snack. Yes, that might sound ridiculous that I remember that specific event, but I think that was the very first event in my life (that I can recall) where I had no desire for children. Obviously, I wasn't bothered by that one event growing up, but when/if anyone asks me how long I've known then I say since I was very young. What about now? Well I'm  23 years of age and figuring out my path to happiness in life. I can tell anyone with a ton of confidence that children and having a family is not part of my life plans. Families can consist of two people - a woman and a man (pets are optional of course, but count towards that as well). Unfortunately, that is not very accepted by cultural tradition. Fuck tradition. We live in the 21st century, where technology is progressing exponentially and society has failed to keep up. The statistics cannot be denied that more women are either delaying reproduction or foregoing it completely to have a fulfilled life on their own terms. There is nothing about motherhood that makes a woman complete. We have reproductive organs that we can disable if we want (hopefully there will be a solution to disable periods without extremely invasive surgery or hormonal stuff). 

There are a lot of reasons why I'm childfree. I could write an entire essay about it, which I plan to do once I have the time to sit down and write more. But it all boils down to one short explanation: I have no desire and I would be a bad parent. I have ZERO desire. I don't hate kids. I simply have no warm feelings towards them or can relate to them. I never envision spending part of my precious time on Earth raising a child from birth to adulthood. I don't have any desire to spend money, resources, and patience to watch a human grow. Time and financial freedom are some of my top greatest goals right now, therefore raising even one child takes away from that overall. 

I have a vision for my life and that consists of being successful in my career, being able to travel around the world, and make a contribution to the planet, society, and universe before I die. Yes, I want to help people.... I want to help people that ALREADY EXIST. I want to help family and friends as I am able to. I want to be able to donate to charities that resonate with me.... I want to reward myself in my success, yet I am considerate to others that are important to me. 

What about love? Yes, I want to fall in love in my lifetime also, which is my greatest fear when it comes to thinking about being childfree. Having a life partner who cares about you, respects you, supports your crazy ideas, and enjoy life without children almost seems like a fantasy unicorn world. I have an absolutely amazing boyfriend, but I get fearful from time to time. Not going into detail like others have shared on this forum, but my heart goes out to you all who have either suffered heart break or depression because your partner wants to have children unexpectedly. I think the worst part is that there is no compromise for those who have been in a serious relationship for so long. You either have a child or you don't. If you don't then the other person will resent you. If you cave in, then you're going to resent the other and live in agony for 18 years (in the United States at least). 

What have I done to finalize my childfree lifestyle? Well, I haven't.....yet. I am scared to death of tubal litigations, Essure, and even a hysterectomy. I don't have painful periods or cramps.

My bisalp and ablation experience,"I’ve been debating on positing about this here. I don’t want this to be seen as an attempt to stop someone from choosing sterilization. Shit, by the time I get this fixed I will be sterilized for the third time. I just want to hopefully save one person from what is happening to me. 

In 2016 I had Essure placed, but the coils started to bother me so in 2019 I had a bisalp and ablation. My recovery was nothing. It was a grand ol’ time. The first two years were amazing. Until September of last year. 

I began feeling like I was having cramps, but I couldn’t tell if it was uterine cramps or if I was constipated, honestly. I went to my gyn who scheduled me an ultrasound to make sure everything is okay. 

They found that I was beginning to bleed behind my scar tissue, and the blood was trapped. Each month things got worse. My uterus contracts continually to try to get it out, but there is no where for it to go as my tubes and cervix are closed off. My gyn says it is worse than labor. It lasts for two weeks every two weeks until my body reabsorbs the blood. 

This month the pain is at an all time high. I take toradol, percocet, and dilaudid, none of which work. I’ve been to the ER twice in the last week where they tell me there is nothing stronger they can give me. The end is in sight for me. I have a hysterectomy scheduled for the 1st, after battling insurance for months for it. I just have to somehow make it through the next nine days. I just writhe in bed, scream, cry, and vomit from pain until then. 

What I have is rare, but please don’t take the chance of it happening to you. Just do the tubal, or opt for a hyst. Please don’t do what I did.

I have three cats, but he has bonded with me much more than the other two. Right now as I'm eating my breakfast, he's in my lap purring and enjoying being held. He has come a long way since we rescued him. He spent weeks under the bed and it was months before anyone could pick him up.

They are my world and I wouldn't trade them for anything. When I got my Essure done, they all got in my lap and purred together. They took care of me as best as cats could for the next few days.

My fur children are much more loving than any human child ever could be. I pour all my extra money into their care. They get the best food, the best water, the best litter. They are so healthy. I couldn't be more proud of them.

Quick vent about my Essure nurses.,"So I got my Essure done yesterday!  Whoohoo!  

I'll be posting on r/sterilization in a bit, but I just needed to vent for a sec about the nurses that assisted my procedure.  I'm still a little sore, both literally and figuratively.

&amp;nbsp;

So I'm lying on the table all drugged up and ready to go, when the nurses come in.  They came in one at a time, each attempted to shoot the sh** with me and both of them seemed cool until they each felt the need to ask ""and you're **sure** you want to do this?"" 

&amp;nbsp; 

I was on a buttload of ibproufen and a strong cocktail of narcotics, so I was able to let it slide and just said ""Yeah, it's just never something I've wanted.""  The first one was cool and admitted ""well, I guess it's not for everyone,""  but the second one kept on with condescending stuff like ""Only if you're **sure** it's what you want...""  It didn't help that they were both literally looking down at me at this point.

&amp;nbsp;

My first thought was 'Uh, I'm sitting in a room full of strangers with my **pants** off and my private business on display, about to go through torture.  You *really* think I'd do this to myself if I wasn't completely sure?'  Of course I didn't say this as I didn't want to piss of the people that would soon be using sharp, painful instruments on me.

&amp;nbsp;

But really, I'd already signed the waiver, what's the point of asking me now?  The heck were they expecting?

Had my consult for sterilization today!28/F/GA and single,"Lurker now posting, blah blah. Just wanted to share my excitement!

My consult was less than 30 minutes long and doc didn't bingo or argue with my reasoning at all. I was shocked! I went in there prepared to beg and had all sorts of responses to bingos at the ready. 
He just asked me about my reasoning (I'm on my second Mirena, placed a critter for adoption in 2010, I have a laundry list of MH diagnoses, take a lot of psych meds, and the critter is already in OT for crippling anxiety, meaning I need not spread my seed again. Plus, yanno, I don't want to parent.) and said they usually recommend long-term BC, but that I've obviously jumped through that hoop already. 
I let him know that I had been seeking sterilization since the unfortunate birthing incident. He said that I seemed very certain and knew what I was doing, and went over the different options. Then we scheduled my pre-op appointment for the 24th! A week after my birthday! 🙌

I can't do Essure due to a severe nickel allergy and would prefer to have my tubes completely removed with an ablation. He said that the method could be nailed down at pre-op, since we'll have to see what's covered. I know that ligation is 100% covered under family planning, and the removal/ablation can be covered under preventative care if doc bills it right. I do have nightmarish periods off of BC and my mom's got shitty after her tubal, so there's hope for the ablation at least!
Off to see if I can dig up any family history of lady cancer.


PS I can't add him to the list right now, but I saw Dr. Christopher Cagle at Kaiser Permanente TownPark in Kennesaw, GA. 
I'll have to look up the surgeon's name after that appointment. Dr. Cagle doesn't perform the procedure, just approves it.

Adding a new doctor to the list (for real this time)!,"Hey all,

Last time I posted I was pumped that my new PCP was awesome and referred me for a consultation for permanent birth control no problem. I jumped the gun and added her to the list until I was informed that the list is more for OB/GYN's as they are the ones who would actually approve and perform the procedure.

So update, I am still adding someone to the list!

I was a little worried yesterday as I received a call from their office for filling out a medical release form for my previous docs as I'm from out of state. The two different receptionist's seemed perplexed that I had never had a previous OB/GYN. Each one asked me about 3-4 times ""so, you've never had a OB/GYN?"", ""no, but, did you have one in (home state)?"" It made me nervous but I figured they're just accustomed to most women (around here at least) having kids by now.

I was nervous for the actual appointment but came prepared with two printed, peer-reviewed studies on the percent of regret (lowest for women with no kids) after sterilization and a two page typed paper on all of my reasons. Maybe a little overkill but I wanted to be ready in case they tried to write me off.

The nurse aid was super cool and friendly. While the doctor asked me questions it seemed much more of making sure I was educated on all of my choices. Technically he bingo'd me a bit, by asking ""what if you meet the perfect guy?"", and asked ""are you really sure you wouldn't want to just do an IUD? It's 10 years."" He listened to my responses though and his tone of voice wasn't judgmental at all. I won't fault him for simply being curious and assuring that a patient is aware of their options and that they've thought the issue over. He said he's still a little hesitant as I'm ""young"" (25) but he will do it!

I should get a call in a few days to schedule for essure. 

I didn't even have to show him my print-outs of the studies nor my 2 page typed reasons list.

Each one asked me about 3-4 times ""so, you've never had a OB/GYN?"", ""no, but, did you have one in (home state)?"" It made me nervous but I figured they're just accustomed to most women (around here at least) having kids by now.

I was nervous for the actual appointment but came prepared with two printed, peer-reviewed studies on the percent of regret (lowest for women with no kids) after sterilization and a two page typed paper on all of my reasons. Maybe a little overkill but I wanted to be ready in case they tried to write me off.

The nurse aid was super cool and friendly. While the doctor asked me questions it seemed much more of making sure I was educated on all of my choices. Technically he bingo'd me a bit, by asking ""what if you meet the perfect guy?"", and asked ""are you really sure you wouldn't want to just do an IUD? It's 10 years."" He listened to my responses though and his tone of voice wasn't judgmental at all. I won't fault him for simply being curious and assuring that a patient is aware of their options and that they've thought the issue over. He said he's still a little hesitant as I'm ""young"" (25) but he will do it!

I should get a call in a few days to schedule for essure. 

I didn't even have to show him my print-outs of the studies nor my 2 page typed reasons list. It seemed to help a bit that I've done my research as he was a bit surprised I knew about each specific method of tubal ligation and possible risks associated with each.",adding new doctor list real time hey last time posted pumped new pcp awesome referred consultation permanent birth control problem jumped gun added list informed list one actually approve perform procedure update still adding someone list little worried yesterday received call office filling medical release form previous doc state two different receptionist seemed perplexed never previous one asked time never one home state made nervous figured accustomed woman around least kid nervous actual appointment came prepared two printed study percent regret lowest woman kid sterilization two page typed paper reason maybe little overkill wanted ready case tried write nurse aid super cool friendly doctor asked question seemed much making sure educated choice technically bingo bit asking meet perfect guy asked really sure want iud year listened response though tone voice judgmental wo fault simply curious assuring patient aware option thought issue said still little hesitant young call day schedule even show study page typed reason list seemed help bit done research bit surprised knew specific method tubal ligation possible risk associated

Anybody experience with the Essure procedure?,"I've been posting on this subreddit a lot and on one of my last posts someone mentioned the Essure procedure as an alternative to getting your tubes cut or tied, but at that point I thought I was  allergic to nickel. As it turns out I am not anymore, it was apparently a childhood thing. 

Now the Essure procedure has sparked some interest especially because my doctor told me the cysts on my ovaries don't require them to be removed after all. 
The Essure less risky since you're not under anesthesia and since other organs are not at risk of being harmed and you obvously don't get your stomach cut open. 
That sounds pretty good but the failing rate is slightly higher than when you get your tubes cut.

An encouraging tale.,"Sorry for any formatting or grammatical errors. I'm not that smart and I'm on mobile. I just wanted to share.

So from what my best friend (we've known each other since we were twelve) and my mother tell me, I've always been childfree. I guess I never really acknowledged it until 2 years ago. I not a person that processes things quickly, but I digress.

  A month ago, I decided to ask my doctor what my options are for sterilization. I went in hopeful, but prepared to be rejected, but she has always been very kind and she listens very well. She told me that if I chose an IUD that she could do it, but that she would have to refer me to a gyno for actual sterilization. I got my reference that afternoon and had an appointment last Friday.

 I was approved immediately. The doctor I saw treated me like an adult who is capable of making decisions, and that it was a matter of what I wanted to do. I had done some research on my own already, and she gave me some more information and eventually I decided on the Essure coils. 

  My appointment is in December, largely because we have to time it with my menstrual cycle, and also because the OR has been booked solid till then. I'm so stoked and I'm so happy that I didn't have to doctor shop!

   I lurk a lot on r/childfree and I read so many messed up stories, and I guess it made me nervous that I was going to be rejected or patronized. There was no ""You're so young."" or ""Everyone wants kids."" No bingos. I was heard, believed and understood. It was awesome!

Surprising turn with my mother (update),"A little while ago i posted about how my mom still didn't believe i was CF after years of telling her i was. It was shocking to me because she always acted like she understood and agreed, but now i found out she just thought it was a phase and it would be best not to argue with me

Last night she came to me and asked me about CF. My feelings towards it and my plans for the future, as well as setting up appointments for some sort of implant BC iud or essure in the future. She truly wanted to understand, and although she may never truly understand, she at least wanted to learn about it and hear my side. She was incredibly supportive and i almost wanted to cry.

[Rave] Just had an amazing consultation. A few notes from my doc about Essure problems too.,"From the side bar of friendly docs I had a consultation with one last week. As expected he was kind, didn't question me, and gave me all the info I needed for each permanent steralization routes and non-permanent ones. His wife works at a larger hospital and goes into the surgery route while he does the more simple office procedures.

I was concerned about the recent Essure complications and he happened to have some good points about it.

1) A couple of the people coming forward with problems did not come to their 3 month check up where they do an x-ray. Along with checking if the procedure worked they also check if the coil has gone up the tube and into the abdominal area, which causes a lot of problems.

2) It's a fairly new procedure. If a doctor is unfamiliar with it they are more prone to mistakes. My doctor use to preform surgeries like his wife and with his experience would be less likely to make a mistake. He has also done many Essure procedures with great success so having a doctor with experience on Essure is a huge plus.

I posted a topic awhile back about Essure vs Tubal and had replies about the concerns of Essure. Felt like it was important to bring these two points up.

"Birth control troubles. Running out of options, so I hope these current issues aren't caused by the IUD...Any advice?","This is what I've tried:



* Many Brands of Pills: Both combination and progesterone only. I kept being switched because they all fucked up my endocrine system (plus other ones, especially digestive), and caused continuous bleeding. increased breakouts, frequent massive headaches (almost every day), constant fatigue, no energy, little appetite for the entire time I was on them. The higher progesterone ones were far worse. Made PMS/PMDD symptoms continuous (the reason I was put on them in the first place).





* Depo shot: utter hell. Same effects as the pills only worse. My doctor was worried if I had developed anorexia because I had absolutely no appetite and lost 15 lbs in a month (I was already thin). This was supposed to stop the bleeding from the pills but had no effect on that (the pills fucked up my uterine lining--the doctor said it was as thin as a 90 year old woman's, but for some reason I bled while 90 year old women don't. He said it was so fragile any movement made part break off and caused bleeding). Basically constant headache. 




* Condoms: No, I will not use these. Definitely not forever. Sex with condoms aren't worth it because there is a very stark difference between a bareback and covered dick. It is impossible to orgasm with condoms--I know because I have used them with the exact same man doing the same exact same stuff. It is impossible to orgasm from the clitoris; only penetration works. 



* Sterilization: Every doctor I saw was a complete retard who refused to do this solely because I do not have any kids and do not want any. It took me 5 minutes of reading a book about pregnancy to confirm something I knew since I was 5 years old, yet they studied and practiced this for decades and can't seem to understand why some women don't want to get pregnant. There is even research showing that my demographic of women (women who didn't want kids since they were kids themselves and do not have children) are the *least* likely to change their minds. The *highest* conclusion ever has been 4% regret their decision. 

I do not know how to force doctors to use their brains. 



*Lupron: I was told this was not a birth control. But how would it fail to prevent pregnancy? 
I took it to test out a theory, but the result was ignored (idiot doctor admitted it was ignored for the same reason as I was denied sterilization). Basically it knocks out all your hormones for an artificial menopause. There's no way I believe for a second it is not a form birth control, even if only a very short term one. 


Anyway, Lupron was amazing. Like my body on the whole was healthier, my emotions were balanced, cognition felt sharper, etc. throughout the the month. And of course no PMDD. I was given estrogen replacement pills in case I had side effects, but I had maybe 2 small hot flashes the entire 6 months so I didn't really take them. Probably should have anyway.


Sadly this cannot be used long term. 


*Copper IUD: Finally after moving to Minnesota I went to the doctor at planned parenthood that specializes in Essure. She told me the copper IUD is more effective than Essure and that neither would help the hormone situation/PMDD. 

However she did say, if necessary she would be willing to do a bilateral oophorectomy (because of what the Lupron revealed). But as a last option. This is what I want, since I'm tired of dealing with PMDD, and I will go abroad if necessary (if she waits too long and I'm kicked off my parents' really good insurance that would reduce the price to under $3000). But until I can do that I need good birth control. 



Anyway *what's happening now*: 

I was off the depo shot (and the end of the 3 months for the current shot being effective) December 2014 and was on nothing until mid May 2015 when I got the copper IUD. It sucks but it hasn't been very long I know. First of all, almost fainted when she inserted it and for 3 months it hurt like hell all the time. And almost constant spotting for about 2 months. 



But I'm a bit concerned: These past two weeks I've gotten this massive outbreak on my lip line, jaw line, and chin area, including a few cystic (I rarely had cystic or on my lip before and never more than one at a time) and 3 on my lip. For awhile I've been getting moderate pelvic pain--stabs and cramping--after sex and after putting in tampons. This lasts a few hours. This isn't due to lubrication and anyway its not in the vagina. For a week I've had constant pelvic pain and tenderness to the touch (I haven't had sex or used tampons) with some lightheadedness before although that's gone away. 


I also have really long cycles. I can't really complain too much because bleeding sucks ass, but so far they've been about 40 days long (although I'm on day 40 of this one and nothing). I don't know if I've been off birth control long enough that I should be concerned. And yes my periods were different than spotting. 


I don't know if this in general has been too short a time span to be concerned but I'd rather fix things early when it's usually easier to do so, and I'm tired of this shit. I already have tons of psychological problems surrounding my body and fertility, and this just makes that suffering worse too. I mean I have dysphoria but since I'm not trans people are idiots and tell me ""it doesn't count"". uh, yes it does. Plus my hormones are fucked up too which makes it count even more than if it was a gender dysphoria thing (as in I was male, which I'm not). The copper IUD still is painful most of the time, but usually it is mild besides for the tampon and sex.



Also I don't know if any of this is connected to the IUD. It's been awhile but I know it takes some time to adjust and for real effects to become apparent. 


I also know that my body is sensitive as fuck. I cannot wear any type of earrings and every time I got my ears pierced growing up my body rejected the jewelry over a few months (lots of pain and forced migration, and these were tiny studs, and no infection). Didn't like braces either but those were to correct a health concern (not only cosmetic issue). I even have to be extremely careful what hair/face/makeup/sunscreen products I use. I'm concerned that the same thing will happen to the IUD as happened with earrings. 


Anyway sorry this is long. Any help?

Didn't like braces either but those were to correct a health concern (not only cosmetic issue). I even have to be extremely careful what hair/face/makeup/sunscreen products I use. I'm concerned that the same thing will happen to the IUD as happened with earrings. 


Anyway sorry this is long. Any help?

Quest for the Cut: Why are other forms of birth control not desirable?,"*Not Permanent*- unfortunately any form of birth control that is not permanent is not desirable to me. I realize that the argument could be made to remain on the pill that I am currently on but I don’t see why I should have to take a pill every day for the rest of my life until I hit menopause. I realize there are options that do not entail taking pills but I do not like the idea of patches, injections, or the insertion of any devices inside my body that would only prolong the wait to get a procedure I am well aware that I want.

Why are other forms of sterilization not desirable? (Disclaimer: I am aware that many of you are happily sterilized thanks to some of these methods or are actively seeking out some of these forms of sterilization for yourselves. I am by no means trying to say the procedure I want is the only one women should be getting; this is just my reasoning behind why I want a bilateral salp. In short, you do you).

*Filshie clips*:  Along the lines of why I do not want to use several forms of temporary birth control this form of sterilization involves the insertion of a device into my body. It also has a success rate of 99.6% which while impressive is not effective enough for me (Kovacs and Krins). I also do not like the idea of tubal clip migration which will only occurring in 1 out of 1,000 women is still enough reason for me to not desire this procedure (Dua and Dworkin).

*Essure*:  Again, Essure is wrong for me because it requires the insertion of a device, a three month waiting period before it becomes effective, that may need to require the insertion of another device or to wait even longer as well as health risks (the inserts moving, the fallopian tubes getting injured, etc). The failure rate for Essure is also too high for me to be satisfied with it (Planned Parenthood).

*Other Laparoscopic techniques*: While these methods are somewhat close to a bilateral salpingectomy they do not have the benefit of reducing the risk of ovarian cancer, they consist of methods of sealing/blocking the tubes rather than removing them which is more likely to result in a failure of the sterilization process as well as inserting objects into my body. (Planned Parenthood).

Sterilization Failure:

“United States-based CREST study reported a 10-year cumulative failure rate of 1.85% for all sterilization methods. CREST's cumulative rate of 1.85% represents a summary figure encompassing the rates for many different occlusive methods. The 10-year cumulative failure rates range from a low of .75% for unipolar coagulation and postpartum partial salpingectomy to a high of 3.65% for spring clip application. Because it has been in use for only a few years, long-term failure rates are not available for the Essure transcervical method of sterilization” (Cullins).

“Reasons for sterilization failure include undetected preexisting pregnancy (luteal phase pregnancy), occlusion of the wrong structure, incomplete or inadequate occlusion, slippage of a mechanical device, development of a tuboperitoneal fistula, and spontaneous reanastomosis or recanalization of the previously separated tubal segments. If the wrong structure is occluded, it is commonly the round ligament. When sterilization failures occur with the use of rings and clips, incorrect positioning of the device relative to the tube is commonly identified as the cause. With failures after bipolar cautery, incomplete destruction of an adequate length of tube is the usual cause” (Cullins).

“When sterilization failure occurs, the pregnancy is more likely to be ectopic than it would be in a woman who has not been using contraception and becomes pregnant. In the CREST study, of the 143 pregnancies that occurred after failed sterilization, one-third were ectopic. This level far exceeds the .05% ectopic pregnancies that can be expected among women using no contraception who become pregnant. CREST data further showed that the proportion of ectopic pregnancies was three-times greater 4 or more years after sterilization, compared with failures occurring during the first 3 years after the procedure” (Cullins).

Update on the bumpy ride to sterilization!,"For those of you following my story, it first started [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/32qgio/i_could_just_cry_right_now/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/33i1zc/dammit/), where I was approved for Essure, but then my lovely insurance company got in the way.

Upon hearing the news that I couldn't get Essure after all, my wonderful husband immediately began his efforts towards a vasectomy. We got an appointment for the following week (which occurred last Monday).

The appointment was a dream. There was no justifications asked. Just an explanation of what the procedure was, what follow-up looked like, confirming that we understood the procedure was permanent, etc. Though my appointment for Essure went well, it was an entire appointment of me convincing the doctor that I have valid reasons for not wanting children. Husband's nurse practitioner actually said the words ""it's your body; you can do whatever you want with it."" It was amazing to be respected and not overlooked because of our age. 

On Tuesday, we received a call saying that the procedure would cost us around $600. Not that we weren't willing to pay it, but it was conflicting with both the ACA and what our insurance rep had told us prior to even visiting the urologist. 

Today, I got a call back that it will be covered 100%!

I was refused today. [rant],"22F, wanting bilateral salpingectomy or tubal coagulation method depending on insurance. I went to a ""consultation"" just now.

Ugh! I'm so....so *angry*! I was nervous going in. I was articulate and practiced and ready for any bingo. I wrote everything down. I brought *studies*. I had more than one on regret alone. I was researched and ready and calm as I was going to be.

100% utter shutdown. Immediate no. She says half the people that come in for this, come back regretting their decision. No bingos - she was fine with the idea, fine with never having kids, but outright ethical refusal on any permanence. Because regret. She said she'd ask around for me, but none of her colleagues would perform a permanent procedure under 30. In *New Jersey*! I knew I might have to put up with this if I were in the southern states or the Midwest. But *Jersey*?

Gods, I'm so aggravated and disappointed and UPSET at her flat refusal. I gave her the statistics and she still insisted the rate was too high. I was articulate and as calm as possible when I told her I'm not one of those people. I was researching it, following it for years. I never want kids. I never wanted them in the past.

I'm ranting here because I can. Goddamnit, I'm not too young! I'm so damn tired of people telling me I'm too young!! 

How many people research and sit on the decision for years on end before they ask?! How many people know the details of what they're asking for, the various effectiveness rates, the risk involved in surgery, the acknowledgement that it cannot be reversed?! Do your older tubal ligation patients sit with the decision for years on end? I rather doubt it. I seriously doubt they spend more than a month or two, if that, and I *highly* doubt they even know there's more than one method, or even care to Google it.

Too *young*? How many people go to you once they're pregnant at 21 and you congratulate them, lady?! You *don't* get to police what 50 year old me might think! That's my job! *My* body! You think it's too risky for surgery, then talk to me about Essure, at least! I know you know about it, there's a pamphlet in your office! Don't ignore me when I ask about it! I'm dead-frickin-serious over here!

"Nexplanon has stopped my periods, so how can I have my essure HSG at the right point in the cycle I don't have?","Pretty much what the title says. It's been three months since I had my coils placed, so I called to make my HSG appointment yesterday. The radiology nurse told me I had to schedule the test between the sixth and twelfth days of my cycle. I explained that I've had like four periods in the last two years and therefore couldn't even begin to guess what day of my lousy cycle I'm on, but she was having none of it.

 From reading up on the procedure, I'm thinking maybe she isn't 100% aware of the differences between a fertility HSG and an essure placement HSG, since she told me the main reason I had to have it done at this point in the cycle (God, I'm so sick of writing that word) is because the test will abort the baby if I do happen to be pregnant, to which I say, a) Good, flush the little bastard out before he takes hold, and b) So give me a goddam pregnancy test first.

So my questions to anyone who knows more than I do (which is just about anyone) are: is possible pregnancy the reason this procedure has to be scheduled this way? What happens if I call tomorrow and lie through my teeth, saying, Gosh, what luck, my period started today, I'll be ready to go next week? Will there be actual physical consequence, or will the worst of it be a radiologist who sort of suspects I'm lying but can't prove it? Should I call my OB/GYN's office and ask her advice/for her to talk some sense into the radiologist?

I explained that I've had like four periods in the last two years and therefore couldn't even begin to guess what day of my lousy cycle I'm on, but she was having none of it.

 From reading up on the procedure, I'm thinking maybe she isn't 100% aware of the differences between a fertility HSG and an essure placement HSG, since she told me the main reason I had to have it done at this point in the cycle (God, I'm so sick of writing that word) is because the test will abort the baby if I do happen to be pregnant, to which I say, a) Good, flush the little bastard out before he takes hold, and b) So give me a goddam pregnancy test first.

So my questions to anyone who knows more than I do (which is just about anyone) are: is possible pregnancy the reason this procedure has to be scheduled this way? What happens if I call tomorrow and lie through my teeth, saying, Gosh, what luck, my period started today, I'll be ready to go next week? Will there be actual physical consequence, or will the worst of it be a radiologist who sort of suspects I'm lying but can't prove it? Should I call my OB/GYN's office and ask her advice/for her to talk some sense into the radiologist?

Sorry about all them words, and thanks for any insight anyone has!

One year post Essure procedure,"I'm 26 and got my Essure placed last year. I posted on here a little before that (different username) discussing it and some other potential options. 

I just want to say that in my own personal experience, Essure has proven itself to be the right choice for me. I have a slew of other medical problems that require me to minimize hormone intake and I knew I wanted it to be permanent. I have absolutely no regrets about the procedure and still have no desire for children (I don't expect this to change - I've had this thought for as long as I can remember). The only downside for me is that my cramps are now more intense than ever. They may naturally be this way and I just discovered my body's natural rhythm over the last year since I had been on BC since age 15. Luckily, the cramps are the only negative side effect that I have. 

I just wanted to give you guys a little insight to the aftermath of Essure, especially with a lot of scary articles that came out about it last year and earlier. If anyone has any questions, I'm happy to answer!

Essure's Dangerous Side Effects,"I began researching essure after reading about it on this subreddit.  When I googled ""essure reviews"" I came across many, many websites where women who have had the procedure done have congregated to inform others about their horrible experience with essure.  [Here](http://www.thepetitionsite.com/422/133/766/essure-class-action-lawsuit/) is an example of one site. 

Many of these women had pregnancies despite the essure, many are experiencing constant pain, but the most common side effect appears to be migrating coils.  They can migrate to the bowels (and perforate them) or to the uterus (often leading to a hysterectomy at a young age).  Some women report that their coils have never been located. 

Personally, i have decided against essure because of the volume and consistency of these complaints.  I thought you all should be aware.

Bummer... Doctor couldn't perform Essure,"Damn... Went in yesterday for the Essure procedure. I had talked to one doctor beforehand and she had examined me, and she told me there was a high chance that I would be able to have Essure, even though I'm obese and I also have cervical ectropion. 

But the doctor who wanted to perform the Essure procedure yesterday (a different one) couldn't find the entrance to my uterus because of the ectropion *and* he thought my ectropion has gotten worse. I had it examined 1.5 years ago including biopsies (they didn't hurt much, by the way, and everything was fine), I had a pap-smear half a year ago (again came back as fine), but he took another pap smear just to be sure.

I have to go back in a week for the results. If it's ""just"" ectropion, they can then offer me surgery to combine the removal of the ectropion plus to put in the Essure plugs. I'll need to have local anesthesia and I'm not looking forward to that. If it's more than ectropion (i.e. a polyp or cancer), other options will need to be discussed. I'm not too afraid that it's cancer, given the previous good pap smear results. But I am quite disappointed that I didn't get the procedure yesterday. 

One of the reasons for this procedure for me was so that I could stop using the Nuvaring for birth control; in return I hoped that would reduce the ectropion so that I wouldn't need surgery for that. 

All in all, I'm just moping about and sulking about the procedure that didn't happen after all...

[Rant] Keep your opinions to yourself!,"So I have a bit of a rant. 

 I went to make my appointment for my Essure confirmation test this morning and everything was going fine until the person taking my information asked for my birthdate.  That's when the bingos began.  
 
     
 So I give the lady my birthdate and she gasps and says, ""Oh my god but you are SOOOO young!  Why would you do that?  You know that it's permanent, right?!""  Well, no shit sherlock that's why I wanted it.  My response was a simple, ""Yeah, so?""  The conversation continued in the typical fashion of ""But what if you change your mind? blah blah blah more bingos"".  I refused to give answers to her ridiculous questions and eventually got to actually make my damn appointment.
  
I will never understand why people can't just keep their opinions to themselves.  It is not her place to say anything about my choices when it has absolutely no impact on her life.  YOU DON'T KNOW MY LIFE LADY!  I'm just really frustrated because I had a similar issue with the nurse when I had my consultation for my Essure which I posted about previously.   
   
  
If I would have remembered the name of the person on the phone I would have complained to management, but it is what it is.  I am now dreading my actual appointment next month.  Hopefully it will go smoother.  When will people learn that this kind of behavior is never okay?

"I'm having trouble finding the right birth control. Progestin gives me severe acne, and I was told not to take the estrogen and progestin combination pill by my doctor.","I hope this is the right place to ask!

Years ago I had Mirena for a year. I didn't get a period, which was great, but I got terrible terrible acne. At one point it was so bad that if I touched my back or chest with just one finger tip, there was not a single spot where I wasn't touching a pimple. I saw a dermatologist, nothing seemed to help. I finally made the connection that it was the Mirena. 

Aside from acne, the Mirena wire poked my husband (lol poor guy). My gynecologist trimmed the wire, but said it had to do with the way I'm shaped. Sure enough, it continued to poke him.

I had it removed, and it took ages for my acne to go away.  

We used the pull-out method for several years, then stopped and had a baby. Then we had 2 miscarriages. I can't handle another miscarriage, and at this point our kid is so old that we'd be starting all over anyway.

I talked to my doctor. She doesn't want me to take the combination (estrogen and progestin) pill because I get atypical ocular migraines and there is an increased risk of stroke.

I talked her into letting me try the mini-pill (progestin) even though she warned me several times that it was the same hormone that was in Mirena, and that it was going to cause acne. I took it for about 2 months before I was covered in pimples again and gave up. Again, the acne took months to go away, and I still have red marks.

The gynecologist literally laughed at me when I asked about a cervical cap or a diaphragm, and said that's how you get pregnant. She reminded me that the implant, depo-provera shot, and the ring all use Progestin and will cause acne. 

My husband gets upset if I even mention the word condom, I've given up trying. He almost panicked when I mentioned a non-hormonal IUD, I think he has PTSD from the wire in the first one.

I talked to the doctor about tubal sterilization, and she had me sold on Essure. She sort of talked down about other versions, and really thought this was the best. I was nervous but happy about the entire thing, until I looked at the pamphlet she gave me. It's made with Nickel. I'm allergic to nickel. Why am I such a pain in the ass?

We're currently back to the pull-out-method, but I miss the freedom that we had with Mirena. I don't miss the acne, and I think my husband doesn't miss the occasional surprise jabs from the wire.

UPDATE: Everything went better than expected!,"I had my appointment on Monday to mixed success. My doctor told me that endothermal ablation will probably not work on me as the uterine lining will just grow back, so in order to stop menorrhagia and the eternal period, it looks like I'm going with Mirena.

The really great news: during the course of her explanation, she said, ""but I can do Essure for you, that's easy."" We had a fairly lengthy conversation and she bingo'd me just a little - never in a judgy way, just giving me examples of people she's known that did actually change their mind. I made it clear that even if my fiancé and I don't work out, I don't want kids for financial reasons, and if I do change my mind (hah!) that I would prefer to adopt regardless of my fertility status.

[Advice] Considering asking my GP about getting sterilized....,"...However, as I'm in Ireland, I don't rate my chances of being taken seriously as being very high. Still, if you don't ask, you don't know. I was wondering if there were any women on this sub based in Dublin who can help answer the following questions:        

1: How much would it cost to have a procedure such as Essure or tubes tied/ cut and burned privately? If I have to raid my savings, so be it.      

2: Can you offer any advice on how to approach this conversation with my doctor? I'm kind of put off due to the overt ""Catholic= BAYBEES"" point of view that a lot of hospitals tend to have in this country. We're *slowly* getting to be more secular but even so, things can be a bit old fashioned in terms of outdated view points.     

3: Has anyone here undergone a sterilization procedure whilst still living with their parents? If so, how did they react when they found out that you were having the procedure? Also, how do I tackle this subject with my mother- who flip flops between the notion ""You're so thoughful for not bringing a child into the world when you have no means of caring for it"" and ""ERMERGERD I WANNA GRANDCHILD 111!!!"".    

I'm a bit scared/nervous about tackling my doctor over this but I sort of hope that several facts work in my favour: I'm almost 30, I'm currently on my second Mirena IUD in what will be 8 years come this October and I have legitimate concerns over passing on mental and physical disabilities to any hypothethical children.      

I just don't know where to start in building a case for myself. I'm worried I will be bingoed to death by my mother if I come right out and tell her of my plans even though I'm a grown woman who greatly believes in body autonomy and a woman's right to choose what happens to her body.  Also, I've been single and devoid of a sex life for 8 years so my chances of getting pregnant are extremely low as is. Even so, I know I never want children and thus want to COMPLETELY eliminate any chances of it ever happening.

Low estrogen birth control recommendations? Brief history inside.,"Little background: I have suffered from severe headaches, almost daily, for the past year. In a last ditch effort to figure out what was causing them, I went off my BCP (Beyaz). Sure enough, that was it. I was hoping it wasn't since it's otherwise been an incredible pill for me.

Problem now is, I cannot stand being back to 'normal'. Periods suck, but it's the menstrual blues I really can't handle. I do not like feeling depressed/sad for no reason and even though I know it's just hormonal, it doesn't keep me from feeling like crying and acting like a loon. I honestly don't have time for that shit and I experienced NONE of it while on Beyaz.

So, I'd like to try out a different form of low estrogen BCPs before throwing in the towel altogether. I primarily use them for period predictability (light and short) and mood control since I have no concern of becoming pregnant (Essure procedure). However, having them as back up has never hurt either since life....uh...uh... finds a way.

Other methods really aren't an option for me since they never work out well; regular dose never works since it makes me incredibly sick, progestin only BC makes me bleed for weeks on end, and I'm fairly sensitive balance-wise so my gyno doesn't think the ring is a good idea.

I suppose it is worth noting that I do not have health insurance at the moment. However, I'm fairly resourceful and know most places offer patient assistance programs that I can afford.

Even if you haven't had personal experience with a LE-BCP, but find a good source/list of different brands, I'd like to look it over.

Female sterilization + IUD or ablation?,"Hey, folks!

I have a sterilization consult scheduled with someone I think will finally, finally take my bodily autonomy seriously (I am very nearly 27 and she performed a tubal on a woman who was 28 at the time). I currently have an IUD that expires in October and hope to be fixed by then.

My question is about sterilization procedures (Essure or a tubal) in conjunction with an IUD. Yes, it's probably overkill in terms of birth control protection, but I also really love not having a period and respond well to these hormones; I'm migraine-prone with a lot of others and wouldn't want to switch to the shot or pill. Is this something people do? Google just shows a comparison between the two, not used together.

Next, do you think that a Healthcare.gov plan (I'm in the US) would cover both sterilization and an IUD in the same visit our shortly after? I know that this is something I can ask them about, but if anyone here has already give through this, I'd love to hear your story.

I've read that Essure installation was overwhelmingly successful (~93%) in cases where an IUD was already in place, which is promising; in those cases, the IUD didn't need to be removed.

My cursory research about ablations signalled that they should not be performed at the same time as Essure (at least, the heat-based one, as it could heat the coils and cause a totally-not-fun situation). I'm also hesitant about the healing process, downtime (~~are they all ~3 months before sex?~~ whoops, got facts confused), and whether my period would actually be eliminated or not. No real way of knowing until after the fact, and since I have a high deductible plan and ablations aren't billed as birth control, that could be an expensive procedure that doesn't work for me.

advice on mirena please!!,"I’m absolutely sick to the back teeth of taking the pill, it’s driving me crazy – I’ve been on the same one for years (celeste), and am getting crazy side effects – if I’m even 12 hours late with one tablet, I can end up spotting until my break 1-2 weeks later. (I’m only meant to have breakthrough bleeding on the breaks)

I also can’t tricycle my packs anymore like I used to, without spotting constantly, and am worried about my blood pressure as well as I’ve had a couple of higher than normal readings in the past year. Plus my hair falls out loads, which is a symptom I’ve seen mentioned in relation to this pill

I’ve looked into the mirena IUD before but dismissed it as I read so many horror stories. I was told at a smear test that I had a high cervix which was unusual, which I was worried may cause problems with the insertion (esp as it can be harder to insert for women who haven’t had children anyway). Then also, my SO is quite um… well endowed, and I’ve read a lot of stories about men ending up being scratched, cut to shreds etc, pain for one or both during sex

I feel like I’m at my wits end, I don’t want to change to a different pill, as I can’t be doing with any random weight gain, spots, moodiness, etc etc. I am considering essure in the next few years, but not just yet.

Finally got essure after a few months delay!,"Other than a few friends I don't really have people that would get it and that I can celebrate with so I had to tell you guys. : )

My appointment was pushed back as my office didn't know if the scope they ordered would be in on time. It did come in on time but I had already canceled my ride with my friend to and from and just decided to reschedule. Due to the doc's vacation and my own vacation the appointment ended up being 2 months later than originally scheduled but I'm patient and was busy so I didn't mind.

If anyone has any questions about the procedure I will answer them! I know people do this a lot but if my answers can help put anyone's mind at ease, ask away!

 I was pretty nervous for potential side effects as I work at a hospital and am going into the medical field (for paramedic) and am very familiar with the crazy things your body can do. For me the worst part was the speculum probably because it is in for the entire procedure vs a minute or less when you have a gyn exam. The shots to the cervix were not all that bad. Once the camera was turned on I was pretty amazed to watch it, I love biology and surgery stuff so that was a welcome distraction. About 5-10 minutes post-procedure it felt like I had a bit worse than period cramps. While I was waiting for my ride to when I got home the cramping was worse, I took my doxycycline and prescription strength ibuprofin and grabbed a heating pack. I timed my appointment so that I could sleep right after (I'm a third shifter). It was pretty uncomfortable for awhile but I finally fell asleep. I had been a little nauseous but I think that was more from the combo of pills rather than the procedure as my stomach is sensitive sometimes. After waking up I felt much better but still pretty crampy. Today I rode my bike to the store and feel almost back to baseline.

Tubal or Essure??,"So I somehow (miraculously) found a doctor on the first try willing to give me a surgery referral for sterilization as an unmarried, childfree 25 year old woman. She wasn't trying to persuade or dissuade me either way, she was neutral and very matter-of-fact. 

I had originally wanted the laparoscopic tubal ligation but after hearing more about Essure and the possible risks of surgery, I was thinking Essure might be a better option. I am extremely well-read on both methods and how they work as well as related risks, and I'm completely at a loss for which one I should do. Essure would be the obvious choice if the internet wasn't so riddled with horror stories, law firms, and support groups surrounding the ""life-destroying, debilitating anguish"" that the Essure supposedly causes. But I can't help but feel like this is just a very vocal minority.  

I was wondering if anyone has had either done (or knows someone who has), why they did it and how it went. Any regrets/etc. It's very hard to find unbiased, ""crazy-free"" information out there and I consider myself very much a skeptic.

Just learned about horrible Essure reactions,"I've (obviously) been looking into permanent sterilization methods--specifically, tubal ligation for many, MANY years now, but I know that at 28, F, no kids it's impossible--I even asked a gyno relative who literally said ""yeah no one would do it for you.""

So then I learned about Essure from the internet and it sounded awesome, and that I could actually get it done most likely. The description was something like ""this is a metal implant, surrounded with [metal] with a nickel interior"" which kind of made me nervous, but at the time (and currently) I'm with an SO who wants babies (long story) so I couldn't get it in any case. Today I just read someone on here talking about how Essure was successful for them so I remembered about the Nickel thing for some reason, and randomly googled it, and apparently a TON of women have horrible reactions to it. I really don't know if it's okay to post links (probably not?) because I only ever browsed reddit (and I'm pretty sure my only post is to the xbox forum) but I found so many stories of people who get so sick from this thing. And also apparently initially doctors had to ask ""do you have metal allergies"" but the company that makes it sued the FDA so that they didn't have to ask that, I guess to implant it more. Shady town.

I dunno, I just wanted to vent about this I guess, it really freaked me out and I'm honestly glad I couldn't get it when I read about it. I love jewelery and have an f ton of piercings but they are all pure titanium because when I put anything else in, my ears swell and I get wonderful smelly pus and pain and crust and ugh. Rings also stain my skin green... I tolerate it because I'm only wearing it in my ears for like 12 hours max and the jewelery is pretty... I just can't imagine that inside of me.

It finally happened.,"After many tries to find a doctor who didn't laugh at me for asking for permanent birth control, I finally heard the magic words today. 

After the last doctor (she immediately started treating me like a child after I asked her) I came into this one like an emotionless robot (more than usual.) The nurse and I chatted about it before the doctor came in. She said, ""its good that you know you don't want them. I always knew I never wanted them, but I ended up with three."" Well...I didn't really know what to say about that. I awkwardly laughed and that made me realize the moment of truth was coming up with the doctor. 

He came in, very nice guy. First male gyno I've ever had. He asked if boyfriend felt the same way about my choice, I told him yes, and that I pop quiz him every few months just to be sure (hey you can never be TOO sure, even after almost 6 years.) 

We did our normal exam and he handed me a pamphlet for IUD and essure. I knew I didn't want either, I just wanted straight up tubal. He said that's no problem and we could set something up whenever I'm ready. I then bursted into tears and told him thank you. I told him how all the doctors have told me I wasn't old enough. Told me didn't really know what I wanted. He said, ""you're old enough in my book, and you know what YOU want."" 

It wasn't about getting it done or not. It's about being given the choice to do it without being told that your choice is wrong. I can vote, I can join the military, I can buy a gun, I can MAKE a baby, but I'm not old enough to know I never want a baby? A full grown adult that has lived on her own and worked full time since 18 can't decide what she wants to do with her body because 26 is too young? Fuck that noise. I'm closing up shop now.

DAMMIT.,"I was so fucking close. I got approved for Essure. At 22. It was a miracle. The procedure was scheduled for next week.

Well, today I get a call that my insurance won't cover it because my doctor insists on doing it in an OR because I've never had kids before. His office accepts my insurance. The hospital does not. No negotiation with doing the procedure inside his office. He doesn't have privileges at other hospitals. He doesn't even have a referral because all the doctors he works with operate out of the same hospital.

"I had a discouraging talk (to me) with bf. Not sure if I should just let things go, or do something about it. (loooooong)","Hi CF. I will try to make this not a novel: [I think I failed at this]


I'm die-hard childfree and I have been since I was six. Current boyfriend, been with him for almost 2.5 years, best one I've ever had. When we started dating, I made it clear that I was CF, he said he didn't know. I figured that was fine because we didn't know we'd get into a serious relationship or a fling (I was moving away in like 3 months). Stayed together. At some point, maybe a year or so ago, we have a CF discussion, brought up by me. He said since his father was shitty he sort of feels like he'd like to be able to be a good father to some kid some day. I explain that I will never give him children, he says he is okay with that. He thought I was in a phase, I explain clearly again that I am not, this [my feeling of CF-ness] isn't going anywhere. He is okay with all of this.


Time goes on, I get more and more vocal about the CF-ness, and the anti-kid attitude. I discover r/childfree, and am always on it. (this is a throwaway, or at least not my main btw). I talk openly about IUDs, Essure, Tubals, endometrial ablasion, and he is fine with everything, accepting even. Saying things such as, ""That's awesome honey, if that will make you happy, go for it."" 


Somewhere here I make a huge mistake. I misread and misinterpret his acceptance of all my spewed vitriol as that maybe he's seen the light and is sort of childfree too. Here I will mention that at one point earlier in our relationship when I was having uterus problems he OFFERED to get a vasectomy. I said no, that I am the no-holds-barred CF-er and if someone is getting a surgery it will be ME.


So I go to the doctor this week, she asks me if my boyfriend is CF too. I said, ""I think so."" She asked, ""Well why doesn't he get a vasectomy? It's easier than you getting sterilized."" I don't quite agree with that sentiment but whatever. I told her same thing, i.e., I'm the die-hard CF-er, I will be getting the surgery(ies).


I never should have asked, I knew it was murky territory and every time I bring it up, we reach some half-cocked decision and I get upset. I asked my bf if he would consider getting a vasectomy. He said ""no."" I should have let it be. I asked ""Why?"" He said ""I might want to have kids someday."" And then I get upset (not hulk angry, more sad, freak out upset).


The thing that I really really don't get though is what came out of my bf's mouth during this whole exchange. I think he's deluded to be honest and I want opinions.


He understands I will not succumb to pregnancy, and he is pro abortion should I become pregnant. He said that ""If I decide I want a kid, I will do it on my own. Will me spending time with a kid make you jealous?""


WTF?


He didn't mean he was going to get some woman knocked up, steal her baby and peace out, he also didn't mean he was going to swipe a kid from the local K-mart. He means that he will adopt a kid, and will I be jealous of him splitting his time. He said (deluded) that I'll never have to do anything with the kid or even SEE IT. How the hell...


I asked him why he wanted a kid. He said so that he could experience unconditional love. I believe you can experience that with relationships, and he agrees. We do love each other very much (except for this shit.)


He says he wants someone to take care of him when he is old. I told him (this morning not last night) that that is one of the weakest arguments for having children ever. There is NO guarantee your kids will take care of you at all. Moving on...


I explained adoption is expensive and that kids are expensive. HE AGREED. Even went so far as to say, ""Yeah I may not make enough money to have a kid or adopt one and I don't believe in raising a kid half-assed."" That's good at least.


He also said that they weren't ""fun"" (like what a playmate for you?) for the first several years. So....you don't want the baby-toddler-small smelly hurricane stage but you want one you can talk to. He mentioned talking to it.


I'm sorry but what the actual fuck, CF? I just can't wrap my head around this. One hand, and I told him this, I feel that breaking up would allow him time to find a woman to give him that kid and a white picket fence. However he ASSURES ME that it isn't the woman thing. It's just a kid thing. If he wants a kid, he'll get one...somehow.


The other hand, he still sounds like a fence sitter. Also sounds like he wants to pick and choose the best parts. He's mid -twenties and no, I don't think he has ever sat down and REALLY thought of the consequences of either natural or adopted children. He isn't dumb, but very ""live in the moment and don't sweat the future which hasn't happened yet."" I, however; have thought about all the aspects of children - natural and adopted. I am 150% sure that I will not have natural children. The adoption thing? I think it is great to adopt, but I just don't know if it is for me. It is still a kid and they skeeve me out. 


Everything he has said though is just. so. weird though! Thanks for reading if you made it this far.

He also said that they weren't ""fun"" (like what a playmate for you?) for the first several years. So....you don't want the baby-toddler-small smelly hurricane stage but you want one you can talk to. He mentioned talking to it.


I'm sorry but what the actual fuck, CF? I just can't wrap my head around this. One hand, and I told him this, I feel that breaking up would allow him time to find a woman to give him that kid and a white picket fence. However he ASSURES ME that it isn't the woman thing. It's just a kid thing. If he wants a kid, he'll get one...somehow.


The other hand, he still sounds like a fence sitter. Also sounds like he wants to pick and choose the best parts. He's mid -twenties and no, I don't think he has ever sat down and REALLY thought of the consequences of either natural or adopted children. He isn't dumb, but very ""live in the moment and don't sweat the future which hasn't happened yet."" I, however; have thought about all the aspects of children - natural and adopted. I am 150% sure that I will not have natural children. The adoption thing? I think it is great to adopt, but I just don't know if it is for me. It is still a kid and they skeeve me out. 


Everything he has said though is just. so. weird though! Thanks for reading if you made it this far.

Appointment moved,"Guys, I need to vent.  I'm so pissed off right now.  

Back in February I had the Essure coils placed and then you have to wait 3 months for them to check to make sure the tissue has formed and is blocking the tubes.  The day of my appointment, after I got home and was just hanging around I called to schedule the appointment for my confirmation test.  

Today was my appointment, 5 minutes before I'm about to leave work I get a phone call from the Doctor's office saying the test can't be done in the office, it has to be done in the hospital and asked if the 19th worked.  

Not only has this appointment been on their calendar for 3 months and they could have caught that any other day that who ever scheduled it did it wrong, but they call me THE DAY OFF MY APPOINTMENT to tell me nope, don't come it.  She refused to say sorry for someone messing up, she refused to put any blame on the office at all.  Instead she blamed me.  ""The people who schedule the appointments only know to schedule what the people tell them to schedule""  Really, because when I called in I said that my Dr. told me to call and schedule an appointment for the follow up test for the Essure coils that I just got placed today.  I'm sorry I don't know the technical term for the fucking procedure.  

I just want to know if I'm sterile or not.  Now I have to wait a week and a day longer...

And I know it sucks, a lot of people can't even get done what I had done and I'm bitching about needing to wait another week and a day but I'm so angry right now.  Not so much that I have to wait a week and a day but that they call me just 2 hours before my appointment to tell me I messed up and they need to change the date. 

I love my Dr. so of course I'm not going to go anywhere, but I will tell her all about how they fucked up.

Endromedal Ablation and bad cramps?,"I'm a 22 years old and have been staunchly childfree for as long as I can remember.  (And, quite frankly, horrified about the idea of pregnancy.)  Unfortunately, I've also been dealing with heavy, long periods that last at least 10 days.  I get severe cramps as well for the first couple days that more often than not don't respond to Tylenol (I'm allergic to Ibuprofin) or heat.  All in all, this makes me pretty miserable, and even more frustrated than the average person since I don't even want anything to do with this ""feature"" of my body.  Sigh.

I tried hormonal birth control a few years back, first the progesterone only pill for a month, then the regular one (I switched as the progesterone pill gave me bad acne).  I  had to stop the combo pill after a month as well as I started to experience mood swings that spiralled into severe depression.  Also, I have a history of migraine with aura.  Needless to say, I have no desire to ever experiment with hormonal contraception ever again.  Unfortunately, every gyno I've been too has only offered me hormones, and flat out stated they couldn't help me when I told them I didn't want to mess with those again.

At this point, I just want the periods gone.  I've recently been looking into endrometal ablation (and essure), but noticed that it's counterindicated for those with heavy cramping.  I've also read multiple reviews on the procedure where women complain that their cramps have been worse afterwards.  And then there's the chance that it doesn't completely work, and the periods come back or never totally go away in the first place.  I'm not opposed to a hysterectomy per say, just concerned about undergoing an an operation of that magnitude that isn't strictly medically necessary, what with the risks and all the downtime afterwards.

I'm posting this here as I'm hoping that some of you fellow CF gals have some experience with ablaton and heavy cramps, and could give me a little advice that isn't the ever-condescending ""suck it up and live with it because you might change your mind someday"" that is so common.  I'm just so friggin' *DONE* with spending half my life uncomfortable and uselessly bleeding from my junk haha.

Failed Essure confirmation test,"As a followup to this post [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/2atnmy/i_had_the_essure_procedure_done_at_22/)...

I failed my Essure confirmation test today &gt;:(

Not because the coils were improperly placed, but because of my freaky uterus. I've been told that it's ""weird shaped"" a few times, but the only other times they were poking around in there was when I was in surgery. 

Now they're going to have to find a hospital with the proper equipment to use on my freaky uterus, and I'm going to have to wait another month until whenever it's 7-10 days from my next period. I don't have any insurance either.

"14 days after our wedding, my husband followed through with his vasectomy!","I got the Essure method of sterilization done this past December, before we were engaged. We got engaged in March and married on Bastille Day, had a fantastic honeymoon, which had minimal child annoyances along the way, and now we're home and he followed through with his promise to me that he'd get snipped!
He wanted it for himself anyway to reflect his anti-humanity views, but also because I have a higher than average risk of ectopic pregnancy with the Essure, so he doesn't want to risk hurting/potentially killing me. What a keeper.

Our family is complete, with 3 cats, a snake, and 4 aquariums. Only some of my mom's friends commented on her wedding post if ""we'll hear pitter patters of small feet soon"", which my mom and brother quickly shut down with a ""only if it has 4 legs"" comment. 

I've been taking care of him all weekend, which is both comical and pitiful, passing the frozen peas back and forth to the freezer, making sure he has enough snacks and water while he plays video games.

Essure: Thoughts on losing what saved my life.,"I’m on mobile, so I apologize for formatting and not having the links to the Essure studies I researched. Also, there isn’t a “vent” flair as far as I can tell, so rave it is I guess?  
  
I’m seeing my gynecologist tomorrow in regards to possibly removing my Essure. I hadn’t realized that all of my symptoms that I had just been dealing with were connected (at least a little bit) until I started researching Essure upon hearing it was no longer performed in the US.  
  
To be honest, I’m pretty sad about it. The Essure procedure gave me my life back from my phobia at age 22. I was so terrified of pregnancy that I was abstinent despite wanting to do sexual things with my SO.  When the procedure was complete and confirmed, I felt a huge weight lifted off of me and I felt like I could live my life again. It will be 5 years in April, I feel like I’m losing a part of me.  
  
And while I know that in removing it I will still be sterile, I can’t help but worry. Which is why I’ve made notes/talking points for my consultation tomorrow about getting lacroscopic bilateral salpingectomy completed at the same time (which is what they’ll need to do to remove it, but I just need to hear them say the words to feel better).  
  
I know I’m in a blessed position with a PPO insurance plan that I can choose doctors at will, but my phobia and anxiety are still always there. It feels good to know that the end to the symptoms is in sight, but what if it doesn’t work? And I am blessed to have a Manager and Director who are also both CF so they are perfectly fine with me taking time off for the surgery. I’ve dealt with GPs treating me differently since I’ve sterilized myself. In fact, my previous gynecologist started being negligent in my medical care when she found out, which is why I moved drs.        
  
I guess I just need to vent and hear from other people who’ve been through something similar. It’s hard to realize that the best choice for myself five ears ago has been slowly poisoning my health. The choice I made that literally changed my life is changing it again. I’m not scared of surgery, I’m in no danger of not being able to afford it, I’ve got my SO to help me recover. There is literally no better chance at this than now. I want this surgery but I’m having mixed feelings because I feel like I’ve been let down, if that makes sense. If I could go back with this knowledge, I would still choose Essure because it was the best and only option at the time. But maybe I’d be more prepared? I don’t know.   
  
I’m rambling but I’ll end with this: Essure, you saved my life and I’m sorry to part with you. But you did your job the best you could and I’m grateful to have had you.  
  
UPDATE: Spoke with the dr today. She agreed to move forward with surgery, but is also running other tests before the surgery to check for other issues as well (endometriosis, cancer, etc.).

That didn't work. The first one came right out, the second one caused so much pain that I had it taken out (I mean: not functioning at work for weeks due to the pain is just not an option). 

Then I went to my regular gyno to get a permanent solution, who told me that ""we don't do that because women too often have regrets"". Damn. I was 35 years old at that point in time, you would think I could finally make a decision on my own?

Then I went to a private clinic and I will have to pay the bill myself, *but* they promised to do it. 

The first two attempts at Essure failed. First time they couldn't even get into my uterus. Second time, with local anesthetics, the gyno told me afterward: ""Sorry, we couldn't find your tubes so we couldn't put the Essure coils in. This is due to you being at the wrong moment of the cycle""

Friday will be the third attempt under general anesthetics. This time, they will try one more time to give me Essure (I'm now on the pill just to get my endometrium to behave so that they can find the tubes). If it fails, they will do a tubal.

I hope so much that it will finally all come together this time and just *work*. I'm secretly hoping that they'll do the tubal, because if they do the Essure there's still that chance that in three months time one of the two coils hasn't worked, or something like that...

EDIT: It worked!!! Doc told me the Essure worked on the right side, but on the left side the Essure didn't work so they had to do the endoscopic tubal. So now I can do my own left shampoo X, right shampoo Y comparison :-) ; and see which one works best, ha. And can say I had both, or half of each.

Approved for baby proofing!,"I visited my doctor yesterday and she approved me for Essure.  When I told her I was interested in sterilization, she basically just asked me what method I was interested in and when I wanted to schedule it.  We talked about various pros and cons of the different options.

I told her I'd been shot down in the past and she said I wasn't going to get an argument from her as I had clearly done my research and knew what I wanted.  (It also helps that I'm 38)

My cycle is fairly irregular so we're just waiting for my next period to start and then we'll know the best time for the procedure.  We're going to do it in the hospital with IV sedation.  She said that she always prefers the sedation because she can't have the patient moving around or flinching when she's trying to place the coils.

We talked a little about the cost.  The procedure should be 100% covered but the anesthesia may not be.  I told her that after waiting 20 years, I'll pay whatever bill they send me.",childfree,2016-03-11 00:54:14,visited doctor yesterday approved told interested sterilization basically asked method interested wanted schedule talked various pro con different option told shot past said going argument clearly done research knew wanted also help cycle fairly irregular waiting next period start know best time procedure going hospital iv sedation said always prefers sedation ca patient moving around flinching trying place coil talked little cost procedure covered anesthesia may told waiting year pay whatever bill send,approved baby proofing,"Approved for baby proofing!

A Kentucky doctor to add to the database,"[Lisa Crawford, M.D.](http://allwomenobgyn.com/providers/) of All Women OB/GYN, PSC located in Louisville, KY.

Yesterday I had a fimbriectomy, which is a type of tubal that is somewhat rare and extra hard to reverse. My doctor was willing to do the fimbriectomy, a regular tubal, or refer me to another doctor that does Essure, so she's definitely not opposed to sterilizing a 27 year old female. =)

Considering there are no other doctors listed for my state besides one that does vasectomy, I wanted to add her to the childfree-friendly doctor database. I poked around, but couldn't figure out if there's a way to add it myself.

Essure Questions,"Sorry to add to the dozens of posts on the subject, but I'm scheduled to have the essure implants next week and I'm starting to get a little nervous about it after reading so many horror stories. I was SO excited to finally find a doctor willing to talk to me about permanent sterilization and he was actually very kind and didn't talk down to me at all (seriously, this is a first for me). He explained the differences between the laparoscopic tubal and the essure coils, but said that in the last several years most women opt for the latter. He also told me that out of all the procedures he's done only two women asked for them to be removed, but this isn't exactly the biggest city in the world. The coworker that recommended him to me has essure and loves it.

Basically, I'm looking for the opinions of women who have had this done. How long have you had it? What are the pros and cons? Would you recommend it to a friend? I think I was so excited to finally find a doctor that took me seriously that I jumped on the first appointment available.",childfree,2016-02-27 02:08:03,sorry add dozen post subject scheduled implant next week starting little nervous reading many horror story excited finally find doctor willing talk permanent sterilization actually kind talk seriously first explained difference laparoscopic tubal coil said last several year woman opt latter also told procedure done two woman asked removed exactly biggest city world coworker recommended love basically looking opinion woman done long pro con recommend friend think excited finally find doctor took seriously jumped first appointment available,question,"Essure Questions Sorry to add to the dozens of posts on the subject, but I'm scheduled to have the essure implants next week and I'm starting to get a little nervous about it after reading so many horror stories.

Got sat in a cluster of 3 CFs at a party yesterday!,"Went to a coworker's extravagant birthday party yesterday and it turned out so much better than my social anxiety had prepared me for! I sat next to a friend at a table and she had two of her friends join us and it turned all three of us are passionately CF, to the point of cackling over it. One of them almost bingo'd me by saying ""but you're still young"" (I'm 37, still young enough to be a first time mom but definitely not *young* young), and I immediately said ""oh no, the factory's been *shut down*"" Which led to a fun explanation of what Essure is. 

It helped that there was an open bar (woo!) and that my view from the table was of the deck where about a dozen kids were running in circles (which led me to comment on the brutal mosh pit outside). 

To top it all off, another coworker was there with her quiet, perfectly behaved, freaking adorable toddler and told me that a cardigan I had knit for said toddler was toddler's ""favorite"" item of clothing- she picks it out *on her own*. That made me so happy that somewhere in the ashes of my cold dead heart a little stirring of joy occurred.

Screaming match in my neighborhood today.,"Now that the weather is finally cooling down, I like to leave my front door open to let in the cool air. I leave the screen door latched and my dogs like to lay in front of it and watch the cars go by/birds in the trees/do other dog stuff.

It was one of those nights tonight. Easy, breezy, beautiful ~~covergirl~~ and chilly, so I left the door open. It's 7:30pm. As I got out of the shower I could distinctly hear screaming. Not yelling, full on SCREAMING, coming through my CLOSED bathroom door through the open front door. Intervals of screaming bloody murder.

I'm drying off and putting on my clothes as fast as possible to see what all the ruckus is about. I come out of the bathroom to my dogs looking at me with a mixture of confusion and what can only be described as ""please make it stop"", standing at the door. 

My SO was sitting by the door so I looked at him and asked what was going on. ""The children across the street are having a screaming match, apparently."" Now bear in mind it's been going on for AT LEAST ten minutes that I know of, and who knows how long it was before I shut the shower off and heard it.

I looked outside and there they are, a child that looks to be about 2 and one that looks about 7 (???? child ages are a mystery to me). But they're not just across the street, they're down the street.....3 houses down, to be exact. So at least 50 feet away from my house. I want to stress AT LEAST, because it's likely more.

How in the ever loving fuck am I hearing this from so far away THROUGH MY CLOSED BATHROOM DOOR?! And a better question, Why were the adults not quieting them and instead sitting there encouraging it? Are you fucking kidding me? They just sat there giggling while the 2 year old would scream and the 7 year old would scream back, over and over and over.

I took one long look, passive aggressively slammed the door, and thanked Cthulu for allowing me to have been sterilized at such a young age.

TL;DR: Kids far down the street have a screaming match at 7:30pm, I can somehow hear it through my closed bathroom door. ~~Their screaming attracts wild coyotes, who eat them and vanish into the night.~~ I remain grateful for my essure coils, close the door, and move on with my life.",childfree,2015-09-19 06:27:03,weather finally cooling like leave front door open let cool air leave screen door latched dog like lay front watch car dog stuff one night tonight easy breezy beautiful chilly left door open got shower distinctly hear screaming yelling full screaming coming closed bathroom door open front door interval screaming bloody murder drying putting clothes fast possible see ruckus come bathroom dog looking mixture confusion described please stop standing door sitting door looked asked going child across street screaming match apparently bear mind going least ten minute know know long shut shower heard looked outside child look one look child age mystery across street street house exact least foot away house want stress least likely ever loving fuck hearing far away closed bathroom door better question adult quieting instead sitting encouraging fucking kidding sat giggling year old scream year old scream back took one long look passive aggressively slammed door thanked cthulu allowing sterilized young age tl dr kid far street screaming match somehow hear closed bathroom door screaming attracts wild coyote eat vanish remain grateful coil close door move life,screaming match neighborhood today,"Screaming match in my neighborhood today.

Best method of sterilization for overweight female?,"So, I'm looking through all my options for sterilization, and I'm having a hard time deciding.

I think I'd prefer a tubal (or to just get all that shit ripped out, but I doubt anyone would do it without a medical reason), but it sounds like if you're overweight (I am...though I'm slowly losing it :D ), your best option is just Essure.

I'm *okay* with Essure, but it sounds like it sometimes isn't as permanent as it's made out to be, which is concerning. I want as permanent as it gets. 

There's also the cost issue. If my insurance covers it in full (I know for a fact they'll cover a tubal in full, the insurance lady wasn't totally sure about Essure, but believes it would also be covered) I'll do whatever. But I also have insurance that most places don't accept. So far, on the CF-friendly list of doctors for my state, Planned Parenthood is the only place that will take my insurance.

They suggested a ""light"" breakfast before the procedure, but knowing I had to drive 2 hours to get there, I ate a normal (for me) size breakfast and had a beverage along the way.

I signed the paperwork and was given a cocktail of Valium, Vicodin and another drug I'm not sure of the name of all to help you relax. I was also given a shot that apparently helps stop your Fallopian tubes not spasm during the procedure so the doctor can insert the coils.

They had me sit for about an hour to let the drugs kick in, but I really didn't feel any more relaxed than I was before they gave me the drugs. I have a pretty high tolerance for stress, pain and drugs, so my no fucks given level barely fluctuated.

The doctor did a normal exam to make sure everything was okay and did a few numbing shots on my cervix and left me to wait a few minutes for it to kick in. (I barely even felt the needle go in, this was less than 1 on the pain scale.)

Unfortunately, they didn't knock me out for the procedure, and having had Mirena installed a few months ago, I knew I was in for quite a bit of cramping, so I have the following warning to anyone who has not had the pleasure of having their cervix opened:

It sucks. It sucks a giant bag of gonorrhea infested dicks when you have a cold sore while simultaneously getting it up the ass by a well endowed midget and you have a bad case of I should not have eaten that corner store burrito because I'm pretty sure I might have explosive diarrhea.

Since I've never had children, it just made it that much worse. Your cervix isn't as flexible(?) as someone who has vaginally shat out a human. (Fuck us, right?) I highly suggest you get knocked out for this procedure if you can manage it. You have to lay relaxed while feeling like you need to take a huge dump AND while having cramps more intense than any menstrual cramp you have ever experienced.

It took about 10 minutes to get through my cervix and once the camera was in, shooting the coils into the tubes took maybe 2 minutes and then everything came out.

It's amazing to me how difficult it was to get all the stuff in, but taking it out was a breeze.

Since I wasn't knocked out and they use a camera to be able to see where they're inserting the coils, I got to watch the whole thing in vaginovision. I saw the little coils get placed and I got to watch in excruciating pain why it was taking so long to get the camera past my cervix.

I got a sweet industrial sized maxi pad in case of any bleeding and for all the wonderful seepage (they clean your cervix with betadine and they add water to your hoo haw to help expand and glide everything.)

I managed to take a short nap on the car ride home, and having taken some Tylenol right after the procedure the cramps subsided, which I am thankful for.  (The cramps I had from getting Mirena were consistent and lasted quite a bit longer.)

It's now been about 4.5 hours since I left, and I feel like the cramping is about to come back, so I'm going to begin operation faceplant and go die on my couch.

Update: Tubal ligation type confirmed,"On Friday I was informed there is two types of ligation for tubes. Queue me frantically calling my GYN so I knew which type I was going to get. No response so of course I am panicking and stressed. (Bipolar type two with paranoia/anxiety/manic depression) 

I didn’t know which one was going to be performed. I know there is:

bilateral salpingectomy (cutting the tubes cut out completely) 

Tubal ligation by cauterizing. (Which is what my GYN is doing. Burning 3cm off on each side)

Tubal ligation by clamps

Tubal ligation by clamp and cut
 
Tubal ligation by Essure implants

After he explained that he is doing a larposcopy only through my belly button, I asked him the statistics on failure and getting pregnant. 1 in 400 women who have that particular type done. That really threw up a worry for me. (Probably no need to worry but I want to be sterilized with no chance of getting pregnant ever again.)

I know my GYN is awesome and is going to take good care of me but should I ask to be put on birth control as well? It seems silly since I am getting sterilized but I do not want any risk. The medication I am on will massively deform a child. Talking loss of limbs, organs, etc. That’s not counting if it becomes an ecoptic pregnancy and a trip to the ER. Or worse it actually reaches my uterus and I have to go the abortion route for my life. I don’t want that on my conscious.

I know my GYN is awesome and is going to take good care of me but should I ask to be put on birth control as well? It seems silly since I am getting sterilized but I do not want any risk. The medication I am on will massively deform a child. Talking loss of limbs, organs, etc. That’s not counting if it becomes an ecoptic pregnancy and a trip to the ER. Or worse it actually reaches my uterus and I have to go the abortion route for my life. I don’t want that on my conscious.

Essure and ACA Follow-up,"My original post is [Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/29oqdm/my_aca_open_market_insurance_plan_doesnt_cover/) where you can find some great information that people sent me on this topic.

Anyone with essure on here? Please offer your experience,I am looking to see what kind of experience you've had and any side effects? My sister had it done so that's why I'm looking at essure particularly. She said her cramps are worse than being on the pill. That made me look into it further and noticed far worse side effects and now I'm worried. I have an appt to get it done in 2 weeks so any personal experiences would be greatly appreciated! ,birthcontrol,2017-01-29 23:34:55,looking see kind experience side effect sister done looking particularly said cramp worse pill made look noticed far worse side effect worried appt done week personal experience greatly appreciated,anyone please offer experience,Anyone with essure on here?

"Finally got a pre-op for Essure. Planned Parenthood in Minneapolis has an expert MD in the procedure! People who succeeded, how strong is my case?","I learned recently Essure contains a minute amount of nickel so even though I may have tolerance issues with too much, it may be fine for me. Anyway it would be great to learn how strong my ""case"" is from people who succeeded. And if the doctor there is good I'll add her to the list. Also if you live in Minneapolis/St. Paul they do not outright deny you simply because of age (in case that helps anyone here to know). 

* I'm 22, but I've known since childhood that I did not want kids. I changed quite a bit from young childhood to young adulthood and this never wavered for a moment. 

* Hormonal birth control DOES NOT work. Doctors have been switching brands of pills and depo an average of every 7 months because I get constant bleeding, headaches, crazy water retention, cramps, etc. Basically PMDD becomes constant. 
i was started on bc to help PMDD, but a week to 10 days of feeling like shit (and an improvement until I can go abroad and remove my ovaries for a true cure to all of this) beats constant ""PMDD"" that wrecked my life while I was on birth control. Without birth control my period is 3-4 days with 2 days a fairly normal amount and then very very light. 

* the extra weight of pregnancy would cause my moderate to severe joint pain to get even worse. My ligaments are already at least as loose as a pregnant woman's. Plus I take medication that I can't stop for 9 months and I don't want to cause birth defects if I did want a child. 

* I hate babies and the care needed. If I did want kids later I'd adopt an older child and skip that phase. Besides, that would do a lot more good in the world than producing another new person. That's *if* I changed my mind which is incredibly unlikely. 

*My seizures cause temporary paralysis in my arm for up to a minute or 2 plus weakness for a few hours. I drop whatever I'm holding. Don't really want that to be a baby or even a child. 

* Sometimes when the joint pain gets bad I have to go lie down and not move for a while. There's no cure or even anything that can help unless I want to get surgery on almost every ligament on my body and even that might not work. It's not really a realistic option anyway. How am I supposed to care for a child when that happens? 

* I am the demographic least likely to regret the decision. Regret is low (5-6%) among childless women, regardless of their age at sterilization.

I thought it was best to focus on physical issues, since a doctor could claim I needed counseling instead of Essure. however I've been to many (usually for other reasons but this came up sometimes) and none of them have changed my opinions and ""issues"" with the idea of getting pregnant. It will always disgust me. But a doctor may just tell me I haven't found the ""right counselor"" and refuse me. 


So what do you think? I know you don't know my situation but is there anything in general that would help further, and that I can include or not include depending on my specific situation?

[Rave] It's happening! I'm starting my sterilization process!,"**Background:** 26/F. I've always known I didn't want kids. When I was younger, I thought being a married adult meant you **had** to have kids, so I always told myself I'd just never get married and I'd live alone with cats.

Good thing I figured out you don't have to have kids just because you're married.

I still live with cats though.

Anyway. I'm lucky enough that my high school sweetheart/boyfriend (been together for a little over 10 years now!) also hates kids (so much so that he hopes like hell that none of our siblings ever pop out any so he has 0 contact). He's more than supportive of me getting sterilized. 

So, I found out a couple of months ago that a doctor at my closest Planned Parenthood is on the list of CF-friendly doctors, so I decided I would find out if my insurance covered it.

I kept putting it off, but finally called them today. Sterilization would be covered in full after a 30 day waiting period! Well, a tubal would be. The lady from the insurance company wasn't 100% sure if Essure is covered (which is what Planned Parenthood does), but she advised me to just start the process and don't worry about it (tubal vs Essure) unless it becomes an issue. 

So, my next step is to make an appointment at Planned Parenthood! 

This is exciting! I'm nervous, but excited!

Not sure if/when I'm going to tell my family. We're not very close, so I would probably only tell my mom, and she wouldn't care what I did because it's my life. But it's awkward (because we're not close). But I'll worry about that when I get to it!

Help me get my tubes tied right!,"There are lots of subs where I could have asked this, but you wonderful ladies were incredibly helpful the last time I asked for advice here (which resulted in treatment for possible interstitial cystitis, as well as getting a misplaced mirena removed).

So here's the deal: I am 25, child free, and trying to get a permanent birth control procedure done. Dr kept pushing for Essure, and I held my ground and said I didn't want a foreign object stuck inside my tubes after the hellish time I had with mirena (and it sounds like it's a good thing I did, because it's apparently not recommended for people with nickel allergies- which the doctor did not mention even when I asked, but I am kinda getting used to that kind of treatment when it comes to my lady-health). 

 I initially asked for a tubal ligation over the phone, which the doctor did not talk about (so I don't really know if this doctor, like, does that?)

 He said the other option is a salpingectomy, which I am scheduled for in two and a half weeks.

And I'm...utterly friggin terrified. I don't want to be out of work for weeks at a time, and I don't want to have even more pelvic/abdominal pain. I think I need to vent and calm down as much as I need advice right now.


**So, basically my question to those of you who have permanent birth control (or whose partners do) is: What method did you use? How long was the recovery time? Do you have any issues or regrets with it?**

**And to those that have more experience with doctors and scheduling surgeries than I do: What do I do? Can I just call the doctor's office before the pre-op appointment and say I changed my mind about the type I am getting? Does the whole process of getting an appointment start over from here?**

Questions about Essure and IUDs.,"Hey guys, I'm a 16 y/o female with some questions about this form of bc. I'm currently on Microgestin 1/20 and it's kinda hard to keep up with it and rely on it.

My Sterilization Experience: From Consult to 60-Day Post-Op (X-post from r/Sterilization),"**Here's my sterilization story, I kept a journal of the entire process, day by day. It's very long, but very comprehensive. Feel free to ask me anything.**

*****

**PERSONAL STATS** — I'm 36 years old, insured through Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue New England, and in the US. No preexisting health issues. Previously in a long term relationship with a sterilized man. Currently in a new relationship with a child-free, unsterilized man and back on hormonal birth control. Side effects have included intense migraines with auras, depression, and unpredictable mood swings. I'm terrified of surgery but even more terrified of spending the next fifteen years of my life dealing with side effects, risks of unplanned pregnancies, and the potential risk of losing access to affordable birth control / abortion services under a potential Trump presidency. So I've decided on permanent sterilization.

**PCP CONSULTATION** — Met on July 25th (co-pay $25). Called my PCP and set up an appointment to ""discuss birth control options."" We walked through them all in detail and I said I'd love a non-hormonal, permanent solution so I can stop worrying about birth control. I explained I had always been CF and chose CF partners, was tired of the side effects of hormonal birth control (mood swings, depression, migraines) and this would be my ideal solution. She went over the different options for sterilization and we settled on tubal ligation. No push back or hesitation on her part, likely due to my age. She gave me a referral to an OBGYN surgeon in my network that she highly recommended.

**OBGYN SURGEON CONSULTATION** — Met on September 1st (co-pay $25). I explained I was looking for permanent birth control/sterilization, and that I'm interested in tubal ligation. He nodded, and asked me why. I briefly touched on being child-free, exclusively dating CF people, enjoying other people's children, looking forward to being an aunt, but really being career-driven and not interested in parenthood. I also said I was sick hormonal birth control pill side effects. He smiled, nodded, and said, ""Okay!"" No push back. He showed me Paraguard, the non-hormonal IUD just to be thorough and I nodded but said I didn't want to keep coming back to get replacements or deal with potential side effects like heavier periods or expulsion. He said he totally understood. Then we talked about sterilization methods (Essure, clips, cutting, burning, etc.) and he walked me through diagrams. He said he prefers to do a bilateral salpingectomy (removal of the tubes) because it eradicates the risk of tube regrowth and also lowers ovarian cancer risk by 30%. I said that sounded awesome. He outlined the risks, gave me a consent form to sign, and we set a date for the procedure, about five weeks out. No push back whatsoever. I gave a blood sample so they could run a lab panel on me before I left (free).

**INSURANCE** — I asked my doctor and the billing/accounts lady about what's covered. Their response was that they don't know off hand and that I should contact my insurance company directly. I called the insurance company and they said they won't know until the procedure is actually billed and processed through their system. I looked over the website, under my specific plan. It lists ""voluntary sterilization for permanent birth control"" as being covered and having a $250 copay, but nothing more. No breakdown for various methods or mention of additional hospital / anesthesia fees. I decide my health, peace of mind, and potential threat to my reproductive health options post-presidential-election is worth the roll of the insurance dice.

**PRE-OP CONSULTATION** — Scheduled my procedure for Friday, October 7th (co-pay $250). Pre-op consultation conducted entirely by phone on September 28th. No vitamins or NSAIDS the week before surgery. Shower with anti-bacterial soap three days before and day after (I used Dial). No food or drink after midnight the evening before. No jewelry, nail polish, or valuables in surgery. Must be accompanied by a family member or friend. Advised to wear loose fitting clothing. Gave me time for arrival and directions.

**SURGERY** — 6:15am arrived at the hospital. I wore a *The Handmaid's Tale* tee shirt (no bra), low-slung cotton panties, loose sweat pants that sat way down on my hips, slip-on shoes, and a hoodie. My mom carried my phone, wallet, keys, lip balm, and a panty liner (for post-op spotting).

From there it was all business. Intake forms. Urine sample. Vital signs. Revisit medical history. Changed into scrubs (gown, socks, hair covering) and climbed into a bed. IV put in with a bag of fluids. Stung like hell, I'm a huge wimp. Nice warmed-up blanket was spread over me. Chat with head of anesthesia to go over medical history again. Met with my doctor who was performing the procedure. Signed my consent form again (since it was past 30 days) and verbally acknowledged that sterilization was permanent and I was 100% positive. Everyone gave me the thumbs up. No judgement.

7:30am, the anesthesiologist gave me a sedative through the IV. Within a minute I was ridiculously relaxed. At this point, I could not care less about what was going on. Zero anxiety. Like, ravenous zombies could have burst in to devour everyone and I would have just been fine with that. Everything was wonderful. Wheeled me into the OR and asked me to slide over onto the table. I imagine this would have been scary as hell had I not been doped up, but drugs are wonderful. Oxygen mask went over my face. My last thought was that it smelled funny, like a cheap plastic inflatable pool raft.

9:00am, I opened my eyes in the recovery room. Throat and mouth was super dry. Lots of coughing. A nurse brought in ice water and graham crackers. I sip and snack. I'm sluggish but lucid. There are these awesome massage sleeves on my legs that feel wonderful (they prevent blood clots from forming). They bring my mom in and we chat. I don't feel any pain. Just kind of swollen and tender. I continue to make small talk and answer questions. I confirm that I'm not in any pain or nauseated.

10:00am, I'm cleared to go home! IV and adhesive heart monitor pads removed. Massage sleeves taken off. Mom helped me dress, I was a little uncoordinated but managed. She got all the post-care instructions from my doc. No pelvic activity (tampons, cups, penetrative sex, toys, etc.), sit down baths, or swimming for four weeks. No lifting anything over ten pounds for the first two weeks. I balked at the 4-week ban on sex and the nurse said I could revisit that with my doctor at my two-week appointment. We hailed an Uber home.

**DAY 1** — 10:30am, and we're home. My throat is wrecked from the breathing tube (put in and taken out while under anesthesia). It's like having the worst laryngitis ever. Throat is sore, painful, and feels thick or heavy in my chest like a chest cold. I croak like a frog and try to cough but can't really use my abdominal muscles so it sucks. I drink a few cups of hot coffee (both to soothe my throat and to ward off caffeine withdraw migraine) while my mom gets my prescriptions filled. Still not in any pain from the surgery. Just the throat.

I have both a prescription for oxycontin and for ibuprofen. Since I'm not feeling acute pain, only cramps, I take the ibuprofen. I schedule it every six hours the first day, setting reminder alerts on my phone. There is tenderness, soreness, swelling. Mild to moderate cramps. But no actual pain. I mostly just lay on the couch in a nest of pillows and blankets, and watch TV or look at my phone. I drink a lot of hot tea with honey.

The first time I pee, it burns from the catheter they put in while I was under anesthesia. The second time it stings just a little. The third time all is back to normal. Abdominal muscles still don't really work, so you can't really form a normal pee stream. You sort of just have to let it drain out. Which is annoying because I had to pee every half hour. Might have been that huge bag of IV fluid going through me. There was also a small amount of spotting, but it trailed off by the end of the day.

No gas pain. No nausea. No drowsiness. I just felt blah. Yogurt smoothie for lunch. Pad Thai for dinner. Throat lozenges and tea to deal with the sore throat. I peeked at my belly and it was kind of gross. Orange iodine stains on my stomach, residue from sticky tape heart monitor pads, and traces of dried blood. Big band-aids slapped over steri-strips (surgical tape). I felt super gross but couldn't shower for 24 hours. Just gotta chill and be nasty for a bit I guess.

**DAY 2** — Slept fine (on my back, side sleeping is uncomfy). Still no actual pain. Just tender and sore, like I did a ton of sit-ups and crunches. Swelling has gone down a bit. Removed the band-aids (leaving the steri-strips in place) and showered. Tiny bit of oozing from my navel, from when I tried to bend at the waist to reach for the soap. Patted everything dry and added fresh band-aids (Star Wars, naturally). I ate normally. Drank more tea. Normal bowel movement, no constipation. Throat still felt horrible and I coughed constantly. Ibuprofen every six hours. Binge watched Netflix and played video games. Also, took my very last birth control pill ever this morning. Relieved to be done with it forever.

**DAY 3** — Small amount of swelling remains. Throat felt better, maybe at 75%. Showered again and removed the band-aids, letting the incision sites air dry. The steri-strips stay in place until they peel off naturally. The two small incisions on my lower abdomen felt mostly normal to the touch. Navel is still quite sore and stings a bit with movement when I get up or sit down. There is the faintest halo of bruising around it. I tried to keep that area straight and not bend at the waist. There is also yellow-brown bruising at the IV site on my inner wrist. Did a bit of slow puttering around the house. I made tea, wiped down counters, watered plants. Nothing strenuous. Ibuprofen spaced out every six to seven hours.

**DAY 4** — Throat is 100% back to normal. Stomach is still swollen but significantly reduced. The halo of bruising around my incisions has expanded a bit. Larger around the navel and a slight tinge around the two lower cuts. I can mostly move around comfortably but some movements are difficult. Getting up from a sitting position tugs uncomfortably at the belly button incision. I can bend a little at the waist but can't quite sit at a 90 degree angle because my navel will ache. My lower two incisions appear to be fine. I started my period and it's normal. Just a slight cramp every now and again. Normal flow. No actual pain. Working from home on my laptop. Doctor's office called to check on my progress and set up a two-week follow up appointment. Ibuprofen spaced out every seven hours.

**DAY 5** — Back at the office today (I have a desk job). Typically I bike or walk a mile down to the train station, but today I took an Uber. I could have walked but I decided not to push it. Stomach is still a bit puffy around my natural waistline, so I wore stretchy leggings and let them ride low on my hips. Bruising is more colorful today. I can sit mostly upright, maybe at an 80 degree angle. Walking around creates an interesting sensation, there's a slight bounce to my navel as I move and I can feel it tug inside with every step. Not sharp pain but a definite soreness when that happens. I shuffle my feet and hunch over to soften this effect. By late afternoon I'm tuckered out. Energy levels are about half of normal. My back hurts a little from hunching over. Ibuprofen is spaced out every eight hours.

**DAY 6** — Still too puffy for my snug skinny jeans, so I dug out my pre-weight loss baggy jeans from the closet (glad I didn't toss them). Navel bruising expanded a little more today. Uber-ed to work again out of laziness. Sat about 85 degrees upright in my chair today. The navel tugging isn't as intense as it was yesterday, it's much easier to walk. Strolled around town for a bit after work until I tired out, then headed home for an early bedtime. Energy levels are around 75%. Steri-strips started to peel up at the corners, so I trimmed them back with manicure scissors so they don't catch on clothing. Ibuprofen is now just on an as-needed basis when I start to feel a little crampy in my lower abdomen. Faint, light cramps. Nothing intense. 

**DAY 7 - ONE WEEK POST OP** — Managed to walk the mile to the train station this morning with no adverse effects. Popped an ibuprofen before just in case, but I probably didn't need it. I can sit perfectly upright today and bend at the waist. Walking is normal. Energy levels are rising but still not 100%. Bruising has reached peak color, purple in the center, blues, greens, yellows, and browns. Still rocking baggy, low-rise jeans. Went shopping and accidentally pulled a steri-strip off when undressing in a changing room. Lower incision. It's sealed perfectly, neat, straight, and flat. Looks like a paper cut. One centimeter long. I decided to remove the other lower steri-strip. It's also sealed but it's raised a bit. Walked to CVS and bought a pack of steri-strips (first aid supply aisle), trimmed them down, cleaned the skin, and re-covered my incisions just to be on the safe side. Tip: a cotton swab dipped in nail polish remover will remove sticky band-aid residue from skin. Only took one ibuprofen today, midday.

**DAY 8** — Walking, bending, moving fine. Swelling is nearly all gone. Bruise is huge and dark, starting at my navel and extending down about two inches below. Looks terrible but I feel fine. Incisions are itchy, seems like a good sign of healing. There's just the slightest hint of a dull ache in my lower abdominal area, randomly from time to time. Period ended last night. Totally normal. Went for an easy hour walk at lunch. Energy levels are around 95%. Felt good enough where I occasionally forgot that I'm recovering from surgery. Also, I didn't need the ibuprofen today.

**DAY 9** — Energy levels are 100% back to normal. Went to a friend's backyard BBQ for the day. Helped with all the cooking, prep, and clean-up. Didn't feel fatigued at all. Later that evening, SO and I fooled around as much as we could under the ""no intercourse or pelvic activity"" ban the doc gave us. Happy to report that my sex drive is fully intact and everything appears to be in perfect working order, much to our frustrations.

**DAY 10** — Went to a football game. Also slept on my side for the first time since the operation. Until now, side-sleeping had pulled on my internal navel stitches making them sting a bit and I had been sleeping strictly on my back to avoid that, but thankfully this was no longer an issue.

**DAY 11-13** — Pretty uneventful. Random twinge or flutter once in a rare while but nothing requiring ibuprofen or really note worthy. Swelling is completely gone now and I fit back into my skinny jeans, although I've been sticking to low-rise since the button on mid-rise jeans presses uncomfortably against the bruise below my navel. The bruise itself is finally starting to yellow and fade, but it's still a bit tender if pressed against.

**DAY 14 - TWO WEEK POST OP APPOINTMENT** — At the Doc's office, everyone was super nice and asked how I was doing. Doc came in and removed the steri-strips from all three incisions. Everything looked really great! Like tiny, thin paper cuts. The one in my navel is hard to see, it's so small. After the redness fades it will be invisible. The two lower cuts are sealed up and healed over with new skin. No hard scabs, just shiny pink lines. Right one is still a tad raised but it IS flattening down. I answered questions about my recovery experience and the doc seemed really pleased. He showed me on a diagram how much tube he removed and that he sent a sample off for testing and everything came back normal. He said everything inside looked great, very healthy. I thanked him profusely and told him I was very pleased.

**DAY 15** — Sex is on. Since I now have the all-clear, SO and I decided to give things a go. We went slow and careful, and for the most part everything was good. We changed positions a few times and there were a couple of angles that felt uncomfortable (but never outright painful) so we nixed those and stuck to what felt safe. Also, anything too hard or fast was a bit jarring to the insides (like the cramp from having your cervix banged into), so again, really have to keep things slow at first. But it all still works. Was able to reach climax without any issue or side effect.

**DAY 16** — Woke up with mild acne all over my face. Haven't changed my diet or skincare routine at all and my pillowcases are clean, so I'm guessing this is the ""coming off birth control"" hormone fluctuations. Time to slather on the benzyol peroxide.

**DAY 17** — Well hello Mittleschmerz, my old friend. Definitely back to ovulating because I'm getting ovulation cramps and twinges.

**DAY 18** — Started massaging Mederma into my incisions to help them fade and flatten out. Will report back in four weeks, when I'm supposed to begin seeing results.

**DAY 19** — Cramping has now localized over on the right side, around my ovary. It's a dull persistent pain. Not sure if this is still ovulation pain or what. Will monitor and call the doc if it persists.

**DAY 20** — Still experiencing ovarian pain on the right side. I can feel it in my ovary, abdomen, through my pelvis, and lower back. Taking some ibuprofen for it. Google tells me it could be an ovarian cyst.

**DAY 21** — Yup, it's a cyst. Confirmed over the phone with my doc, a result of coming off birth control pills (which prevent ovulation). Following ""monitor and wait"" instructions, as it should dissolve and reabsorb over the next week.

**DAY 28** — Cyst has cleared up, or at least the noticeable symptoms. Much relieved. Also worth noting that sex life is 100% back to normal. No need to go slow or restrict positioning. All is functioning perfectly.

**DAY 31** — Second period starts. All is normal. Right, raised incision has happily flattened with nightly Mederma application. All incisions are still pink and thick under the skin when pressed upon, but otherwise healing well.

**DAY 34** — Trump wins the election and my one surviving happy thought is that I'm so glad I had this done when I did.

**DAY 60** — Wrapping up third menstrual cycle. Still normal. No ovarian cyst this time around. Navel scar is practically invisible. Two lower scars are fading very fast with the Mederma applications. Smooth, flat, only slightly pink. Should be completely colorless by summer time. Acne is subsiding and my skin is returning to normal hormone levels. Also worth noting, I've received no additional billing for my surgery. So total out of pocket costs for me: $300.

It's very long, but very comprehensive. Feel free to ask me anything.**

*****

**PERSONAL STATS** — I'm 36 years old, insured through Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO Blue New England, and in the US. No preexisting health issues. Previously in a long term relationship with a sterilized man. Currently in a new relationship with a child-free, unsterilized man and back on hormonal birth control. Side effects have included intense migraines with auras, depression, and unpredictable mood swings. I'm terrified of surgery but even more terrified of spending the next fifteen years of my life dealing with side effects, risks of unplanned pregnancies, and the potential risk of losing access to affordable birth control / abortion services under a potential Trump presidency. So I've decided on permanent sterilization.

**PCP CONSULTATION** — Met on July 25th (co-pay $25). Called my PCP and set up an appointment to ""discuss birth control options."" We walked through them all in detail and I said I'd love a non-hormonal, permanent solution so I can stop worrying about birth control. I explained I had always been CF and chose CF partners, was tired of the side effects of hormonal birth control (mood swings, depression, migraines) and this would be my ideal solution. She went over the different options for sterilization and we settled on tubal ligation. No push back or hesitation on her part, likely due to my age. She gave me a referral to an OBGYN surgeon in my network that she highly recommended.

**OBGYN SURGEON CONSULTATION** — Met on September 1st (co-pay $25). I explained I was looking for permanent birth control/sterilization, and that I'm interested in tubal ligation. He nodded, and asked me why. I briefly touched on being child-free, exclusively dating CF people, enjoying other people's children, looking forward to being an aunt, but really being career-driven and not interested in parenthood. I also said I was sick hormonal birth control pill side effects. He smiled, nodded, and said, ""Okay!"" No push back. He showed me Paraguard, the non-hormonal IUD just to be thorough and I nodded but said I didn't want to keep coming back to get replacements or deal with potential side effects like heavier periods or expulsion. He said he totally understood. Then we talked about sterilization methods (Essure, clips, cutting, burning, etc.) and he walked me through diagrams. He said he prefers to do a bilateral salpingectomy (removal of the tubes) because it eradicates the risk of tube regrowth and also lowers ovarian cancer risk by 30%. I said that sounded awesome. He outlined the risks, gave me a consent form to sign, and we set a date for the procedure, about five weeks out. No push back whatsoever. I gave a blood sample so they could run a lab panel on me before I left (free).

**INSURANCE** — I asked my doctor and the billing/accounts lady about what's covered. Their response was that they don't know off hand and that I should contact my insurance company directly. I called the insurance company and they said they won't know until the procedure is actually billed and processed through their system. I looked over the website, under my specific plan. It lists ""voluntary sterilization for permanent birth control"" as being covered and having a $250 copay, but nothing more. No breakdown for various methods or mention of additional hospital / anesthesia fees. I decide my health, peace of mind, and potential threat to my reproductive health options post-presidential-election is worth the roll of the insurance dice.

**PRE-OP CONSULTATION** — Scheduled my procedure for Friday, October 7th (co-pay $250). Pre-op consultation conducted entirely by phone on September 28th. No vitamins or NSAIDS the week before surgery. Shower with anti-bacterial soap three days before and day after (I used Dial). No food or drink after midnight the evening before. No jewelry, nail polish, or valuables in surgery. Must be accompanied by a family member or friend. Advised to wear loose fitting clothing. Gave me time for arrival and directions.

**SURGERY** — 6:15am arrived at the hospital. I wore a *The Handmaid's Tale* tee shirt (no bra), low-slung cotton panties, loose sweat pants that sat way down on my hips, slip-on shoes, and a hoodie. My mom carried my phone, wallet, keys, lip balm, and a panty liner (for post-op spotting).

From there it was all business. Intake forms. Urine sample. Vital signs. Revisit medical history. Changed into scrubs (gown, socks, hair covering) and climbed into a bed. IV put in with a bag of fluids. Stung like hell, I'm a huge wimp. Nice warmed-up blanket was spread over me. Chat with head of anesthesia to go over medical history again. Met with my doctor who was performing the procedure. Signed my consent form again (since it was past 30 days) and verbally acknowledged that sterilization was permanent and I was 100% positive. Everyone gave me the thumbs up. No judgement.

7:30am, the anesthesiologist gave me a sedative through the IV. Within a minute I was ridiculously relaxed. At this point, I could not care less about what was going on. Zero anxiety. Like, ravenous zombies could have burst in to devour everyone and I would have just been fine with that. Everything was wonderful. Wheeled me into the OR and asked me to slide over onto the table. I imagine this would have been scary as hell had I not been doped up, but drugs are wonderful. Oxygen mask went over my face. My last thought was that it smelled funny, like a cheap plastic inflatable pool raft.

9:00am, I opened my eyes in the recovery room. Throat and mouth was super dry. Lots of coughing. A nurse brought in ice water and graham crackers. I sip and snack. I'm sluggish but lucid. There are these awesome massage sleeves on my legs that feel wonderful (they prevent blood clots from forming). They bring my mom in and we chat. I don't feel any pain. Just kind of swollen and tender. I continue to make small talk and answer questions. I confirm that I'm not in any pain or nauseated.

10:00am, I'm cleared to go home! IV and adhesive heart monitor pads removed. Massage sleeves taken off. Mom helped me dress, I was a little uncoordinated but managed. She got all the post-care instructions from my doc. No pelvic activity (tampons, cups, penetrative sex, toys, etc.), sit down baths, or swimming for four weeks. No lifting anything over ten pounds for the first two weeks. I balked at the 4-week ban on sex and the nurse said I could revisit that with my doctor at my two-week appointment. We hailed an Uber home.

**DAY 1** — 10:30am, and we're home. My throat is wrecked from the breathing tube (put in and taken out while under anesthesia). It's like having the worst laryngitis ever. Throat is sore, painful, and feels thick or heavy in my chest like a chest cold. I croak like a frog and try to cough but can't really use my abdominal muscles so it sucks. I drink a few cups of hot coffee (both to soothe my throat and to ward off caffeine withdraw migraine) while my mom gets my prescriptions filled. Still not in any pain from the surgery. Just the throat.

I have both a prescription for oxycontin and for ibuprofen. Since I'm not feeling acute pain, only cramps, I take the ibuprofen. I schedule it every six hours the first day, setting reminder alerts on my phone. There is tenderness, soreness, swelling. Mild to moderate cramps. But no actual pain. I mostly just lay on the couch in a nest of pillows and blankets, and watch TV or look at my phone. I drink a lot of hot tea with honey.

The first time I pee, it burns from the catheter they put in while I was under anesthesia. The second time it stings just a little. The third time all is back to normal. Abdominal muscles still don't really work, so you can't really form a normal pee stream. You sort of just have to let it drain out. Which is annoying because I had to pee every half hour. Might have been that huge bag of IV fluid going through me. There was also a small amount of spotting, but it trailed off by the end of the day.

No gas pain. No nausea. No drowsiness. I just felt blah. Yogurt smoothie for lunch. Pad Thai for dinner. Throat lozenges and tea to deal with the sore throat. I peeked at my belly and it was kind of gross. Orange iodine stains on my stomach, residue from sticky tape heart monitor pads, and traces of dried blood. Big band-aids slapped over steri-strips (surgical tape). I felt super gross but couldn't shower for 24 hours. Just gotta chill and be nasty for a bit I guess.

**DAY 2** — Slept fine (on my back, side sleeping is uncomfy). Still no actual pain. Just tender and sore, like I did a ton of sit-ups and crunches. Swelling has gone down a bit. Removed the band-aids (leaving the steri-strips in place) and showered. Tiny bit of oozing from my navel, from when I tried to bend at the waist to reach for the soap. Patted everything dry and added fresh band-aids (Star Wars, naturally). I ate normally. Drank more tea. Normal bowel movement, no constipation. Throat still felt horrible and I coughed constantly. Ibuprofen every six hours. Binge watched Netflix and played video games. Also, took my very last birth control pill ever this morning. Relieved to be done with it forever.

**DAY 3** — Small amount of swelling remains. Throat felt better, maybe at 75%. Showered again and removed the band-aids, letting the incision sites air dry. The steri-strips stay in place until they peel off naturally. The two small incisions on my lower abdomen felt mostly normal to the touch. Navel is still quite sore and stings a bit with movement when I get up or sit down. There is the faintest halo of bruising around it. I tried to keep that area straight and not bend at the waist. There is also yellow-brown bruising at the IV site on my inner wrist. Did a bit of slow puttering around the house. I made tea, wiped down counters, watered plants. Nothing strenuous. Ibuprofen spaced out every six to seven hours.

**DAY 4** — Throat is 100% back to normal. Stomach is still swollen but significantly reduced. The halo of bruising around my incisions has expanded a bit. Larger around the navel and a slight tinge around the two lower cuts. I can mostly move around comfortably but some movements are difficult. Getting up from a sitting position tugs uncomfortably at the belly button incision. I can bend a little at the waist but can't quite sit at a 90 degree angle because my navel will ache. My lower two incisions appear to be fine. I started my period and it's normal. Just a slight cramp every now and again. Normal flow. No actual pain. Working from home on my laptop. Doctor's office called to check on my progress and set up a two-week follow up appointment. Ibuprofen spaced out every seven hours.

**DAY 5** — Back at the office today (I have a desk job). Typically I bike or walk a mile down to the train station, but today I took an Uber. I could have walked but I decided not to push it. Stomach is still a bit puffy around my natural waistline, so I wore stretchy leggings and let them ride low on my hips. Bruising is more colorful today. I can sit mostly upright, maybe at an 80 degree angle. Walking around creates an interesting sensation, there's a slight bounce to my navel as I move and I can feel it tug inside with every step. Not sharp pain but a definite soreness when that happens. I shuffle my feet and hunch over to soften this effect. By late afternoon I'm tuckered out. Energy levels are about half of normal. My back hurts a little from hunching over. Ibuprofen is spaced out every eight hours.

**DAY 6** — Still too puffy for my snug skinny jeans, so I dug out my pre-weight loss baggy jeans from the closet (glad I didn't toss them). Navel bruising expanded a little more today. Uber-ed to work again out of laziness. Sat about 85 degrees upright in my chair today. The navel tugging isn't as intense as it was yesterday, it's much easier to walk. Strolled around town for a bit after work until I tired out, then headed home for an early bedtime. Energy levels are around 75%. Steri-strips started to peel up at the corners, so I trimmed them back with manicure scissors so they don't catch on clothing. Ibuprofen is now just on an as-needed basis when I start to feel a little crampy in my lower abdomen. Faint, light cramps. Nothing intense. 

**DAY 7 - ONE WEEK POST OP** — Managed to walk the mile to the train station this morning with no adverse effects. Popped an ibuprofen before just in case, but I probably didn't need it. I can sit perfectly upright today and bend at the waist. Walking is normal. Energy levels are rising but still not 100%. Bruising has reached peak color, purple in the center, blues, greens, yellows, and browns. Still rocking baggy, low-rise jeans. Went shopping and accidentally pulled a steri-strip off when undressing in a changing room. Lower incision. It's sealed perfectly, neat, straight, and flat. Looks like a paper cut. One centimeter long. I decided to remove the other lower steri-strip. It's also sealed but it's raised a bit. Walked to CVS and bought a pack of steri-strips (first aid supply aisle), trimmed them down, cleaned the skin, and re-covered my incisions just to be on the safe side. Tip: a cotton swab dipped in nail polish remover will remove sticky band-aid residue from skin. Only took one ibuprofen today, midday.

**DAY 8** — Walking, bending, moving fine. Swelling is nearly all gone. Bruise is huge and dark, starting at my navel and extending down about two inches below. Looks terrible but I feel fine. Incisions are itchy, seems like a good sign of healing. There's just the slightest hint of a dull ache in my lower abdominal area, randomly from time to time. Period ended last night. Totally normal. Went for an easy hour walk at lunch. Energy levels are around 95%. Felt good enough where I occasionally forgot that I'm recovering from surgery. Also, I didn't need the ibuprofen today.

**DAY 9** — Energy levels are 100% back to normal. Went to a friend's backyard BBQ for the day. Helped with all the cooking, prep, and clean-up. Didn't feel fatigued at all. Later that evening, SO and I fooled around as much as we could under the ""no intercourse or pelvic activity"" ban the doc gave us. Happy to report that my sex drive is fully intact and everything appears to be in perfect working order, much to our frustrations.

**DAY 10** — Went to a football game. Also slept on my side for the first time since the operation. Until now, side-sleeping had pulled on my internal navel stitches making them sting a bit and I had been sleeping strictly on my back to avoid that, but thankfully this was no longer an issue.

**DAY 11-13** — Pretty uneventful. Random twinge or flutter once in a rare while but nothing requiring ibuprofen or really note worthy. Swelling is completely gone now and I fit back into my skinny jeans, although I've been sticking to low-rise since the button on mid-rise jeans presses uncomfortably against the bruise below my navel. The bruise itself is finally starting to yellow and fade, but it's still a bit tender if pressed against.

**DAY 14 - TWO WEEK POST OP APPOINTMENT** — At the Doc's office, everyone was super nice and asked how I was doing. Doc came in and removed the steri-strips from all three incisions. Everything looked really great! Like tiny, thin paper cuts. The one in my navel is hard to see, it's so small. After the redness fades it will be invisible. The two lower cuts are sealed up and healed over with new skin. No hard scabs, just shiny pink lines. Right one is still a tad raised but it IS flattening down. I answered questions about my recovery experience and the doc seemed really pleased. He showed me on a diagram how much tube he removed and that he sent a sample off for testing and everything came back normal. He said everything inside looked great, very healthy. I thanked him profusely and told him I was very pleased.

**DAY 15** — Sex is on. Since I now have the all-clear, SO and I decided to give things a go. We went slow and careful, and for the most part everything was good. We changed positions a few times and there were a couple of angles that felt uncomfortable (but never outright painful) so we nixed those and stuck to what felt safe. Also, anything too hard or fast was a bit jarring to the insides (like the cramp from having your cervix banged into), so again, really have to keep things slow at first. But it all still works. Was able to reach climax without any issue or side effect.

**DAY 16** — Woke up with mild acne all over my face. Haven't changed my diet or skincare routine at all and my pillowcases are clean, so I'm guessing this is the ""coming off birth control"" hormone fluctuations. Time to slather on the benzyol peroxide.

**DAY 17** — Well hello Mittleschmerz, my old friend. Definitely back to ovulating because I'm getting ovulation cramps and twinges.

**DAY 18** — Started massaging Mederma into my incisions to help them fade and flatten out. Will report back in four weeks, when I'm supposed to begin seeing results.

**DAY 19** — Cramping has now localized over on the right side, around my ovary. It's a dull persistent pain. Not sure if this is still ovulation pain or what. Will monitor and call the doc if it persists.

**DAY 20** — Still experiencing ovarian pain on the right side. I can feel it in my ovary, abdomen, through my pelvis, and lower back. Taking some ibuprofen for it. Google tells me it could be an ovarian cyst.

**DAY 21** — Yup, it's a cyst. Confirmed over the phone with my doc, a result of coming off birth control pills (which prevent ovulation). Following ""monitor and wait"" instructions, as it should dissolve and reabsorb over the next week.

**DAY 28** — Cyst has cleared up, or at least the noticeable symptoms. Much relieved. Also worth noting that sex life is 100% back to normal. No need to go slow or restrict positioning. All is functioning perfectly.

**DAY 31** — Second period starts. All is normal. Right, raised incision has happily flattened with nightly Mederma application. All incisions are still pink and thick under the skin when pressed upon, but otherwise healing well.

**DAY 34** — Trump wins the election and my one surviving happy thought is that I'm so glad I had this done when I did.

**DAY 60** — Wrapping up third menstrual cycle. Still normal. No ovarian cyst this time around. Navel scar is practically invisible. Two lower scars are fading very fast with the Mederma applications. Smooth, flat, only slightly pink. Should be completely colorless by summer time. Acne is subsiding and my skin is returning to normal hormone levels. Also worth noting, I've received no additional billing for my surgery. So total out of pocket costs for me: $300.

Considering copper IUD,"I've had to stop hormonal contraceptives because they were causing my migraines to happen more frequently and cause significantly more pain.  But I don't want children.  And I'm allergic to latex condoms.  So the copper IUD or Essure look like the only cheap long-term options to prevent pregnancy.

I would prefer the copper IUD as it's reversible and has been around for ages and there are some scary stories about Essure floating around.

The only thing that worries me is I have a very sensitive cervix.  I've had to have it chemically cauterized in the past for bleeding regularly after sexual activity.  Pap smears leave me in tears, which I find amazing because I have quite a high pain tolerance (cavity fillings without novacaine, hiking home after tearing an ACL mid-hike, etc).

Dr. Google calls it a ""friable cervix.""  My doctor calls it ""the inner cervical cells migrate to the outer cervix causing the pain and bleeding""

Does anyone else have a history of sensitive/friable cervix and have a copper IUD?  Was insertion awful?  Would you do it again?  Does it interfere with daily activity or sexual activity?  Are your periods significantly worse?

Bsalp and tubal ligation,"I'm curious. Been reading daily this subreddit, and I noticed 80% of the sterilization posts are about tubal ligation. They never mention considering bilateral salpingectomy, or any notion of knowing the procedure.

I remember when I started informing myself of ways of becoming sterile, I mostly stumbled on tubal ligation. I don't remember how I found out about bilateral salpingectomy, took me longer for that. And even longer to find about hysterectomy. 

I wonder if the people who want a tubal ligation do it because they didn't have the time to look more into how effective it is, failures, and find all the possible options, such as salpingectomy, which is way better.

I saw some people who said they wanted a hysterectomy, but they don't want to lose their ovaries and enter menopause. But there are many types of hysterectomies.

There have been a 2% who choose ligation because they just couldn't find a doctor who does salp in their particular country and were just tired of fighting for their autonomy rights.

I feel that unfortunately many women aren't informed enough, the internet doesn't help that much unless you dig deep and far obsessively. It kinda saddens me see people who get ligation, even worse, the clips version, because being missinformed by their doctors on their options, or not finding enough on the internet.

I was wondering if I should make a post of aaaall the options for sterilisation/period free option I found so far, which there are actually a few depending on what you want (reversive or not, period free or not). If we the childfree people were more informed and fought more with facts and knowledge, maybe there will be a change in the world, we're sterilisation is less frowned upon, doctors don't patronize us as much and actually share facts, real information and more options for sterilisation than just tubal ligation with clips or essure.


Also shout out to the cool dudes who got a vasectomy either for themselves or their partners. Unfortunately I don't have much information on male options if there are any.

Holy shit guys!!! ^_^,"A bit of background, I am 19 and live in Tennessee. Okay so I went to the lady doctor the other day for a checkup and at the end of the appointment she asked if I had any questions or anything else I needed to discuss. Here is the conversation we had:

Me: I know that as soon as this comes out of my mouth you're probably going to say I'm too young to be thinking about this, but I've known for as long as I can remember that I don't want children. I would like to know what steps I can take to eventually be sterilized. Not right now, but hopefully no later than the age of 25 or 26.

Her: I can do it. When you get closer to that age we can start discussing procedures and risks and whatnot. I personally prefer tying the tubes over essure just because essure is a bit more risky. 

Me: Really? That's all? I've heard horror stories of women asking their doctor about sterilization. 

Her: Yeah. That's all. It's your body and it shouldn't be an act of Congress to get your tubes tied. Although I wouldn't do it now just because I know I'm not the same person I was at 19 and regret is the biggest risk of the surgery. But by 25 you can usually be sure about what you want out of life. I think it is very forward thinking of you to ask about it if that's what you want.

"My husband is vehemently child free, me, not so much really anymore. Inconvenient.","So before the ""well its best you go your separate ways"" comments start, hear me out.

So my husband and I are both in our mid-twenties and had been together about four years before we tied the knot last fall. Being surrounded by peers with kids we had the cf discussion early on in the relationship. No babies no way. He hates kids, period. I mean **hates** the screaming, needy, money sucking, sleeping depriving, pooping, peeing, smelly little balls of flesh and organs more than anything and his distaste only ebbs by a fraction as they age. On top of that he has mental health issues that can interfere severely with day to day life. He has even lashed out violently at me a time or two. I can at least defend myself, a child cannot. He knows the issues he faces are genetic and want neither to subject a child to himself when he his unbalanced nor risk passing his genes on and having his child go through the same hell he faces.  He was up front with me at the beginning of our relationship when it became clear we wouldn't be getting rid of each other easily and at the time that fine. I loved him just as he was and why have kids when I can do ANYTHING else?

Up until we moved in together about 18 months ago children had never been part of my plan. Being from a smallish town I wanted nothing more than to live an awesome life in a big city with tons of friends and a cat to come home to every night, and the occasional lover. No kids, not now not ever. But shortly after we moved in together my best gal pal got pregnant. Unplanned. Between hanging out with my now pregnant best friend and living with my then boyfriend my already unstable hormones went batshit and suddenly a sizable chunk of my brain has switched to baby mode. Now instead of ""oh God will someone shut that crying baby up?"" in a restaurant or throwing dirty looks at parents who won't corral their horrible crotch droppings in a store I'm giving puppy dog eyes and sympathetic looks and telling my SO that having a kid may not be so bad.

Like I said, we are married now and my best friend has a wonderfully adorable little girl I can occasionally practice my parenting skills on. I have none. I suck at children. My friend finds this hilarious. I can't even hold the baby right, it's so hilariously pathetic even I have to laugh. I'd also like to add that my own health problems would make it incredibly hard to produce offspring. Like, the fetus will kill me or my body will kill the fetus or we'll both die without constant and expensive medical care for the entire length of the pregnancy. Hence my earlier childfree notions.

Logic, reason, finances, and all things sane dictate that the pair of us should NOT breed. Part of my brain gets that. It's fine with that. My SO even wants to get a vasectomy this year and most of me wants him to do it as soon as humanly possible! I've actually been looking into getting a tubal ligation or Essure for myself. However this horrid hormone addled traitorous part of me is dreading my husband's v-day and wants nothing more than to have an ""oops"" before that happens. I don't know what to do. Even adoption is out of the question because of my husband's condition, it makes it hard for him to handle people and life in general for varying lengths of time as he loses his grip on reality a bit like a dementia patient on acid. And did I mention, at least part of me, still doesn't want kids?! At all, ever, adopted or birthed. Just no.

I would really like this baby wanting part of me to go away so we can go back to being happily CF and not miserably so. Advice?

Insurance will cover a tubal ligation! Endometrial ablation? Not so much...,"I hate my periods. Hate them. They are debilitating, painful, last for weeks at a time, cause me to be tired and grumpy because of the whole losing a lot of blood thing, and just in general, they ruin my life when I have periods. For the last 2 years, I have been on Depo, which has mostly stopped my periods (except for some weird thing a couple months ago), but I want to get off Depo soon (I also don't want to have to worry about my bones and calcium levels), so I figure it is about time to consider a permanent option. I also hate children, so might as well get sterilized and stop my periods at the same time, right?

Well fortunately, tubal ligation or Essure is 100% covered if it's in-network, and luckily, thanks to the doctors database here, the doctor in my area is in network. So then all I have to do is convince the doctor that I despise children and never ever want them. No problem.

Unfortunately, endometrial ablation is not covered unless it is medically necessary as an alternative to a hysterectomy. And to prove that it's medically necessary, I have to have menorrhagia (which I do), but I also have to show failure of hormonal treatment (it is mostly managed with contraception but I just don't want to be on it anymore), as well as diagnostic evaluations of the endometrium and uterine cavity that show no remediable pathology. Basically, no way that I'm getting endometrial ablation covered under insurance, which means I'm looking at $3600 out of pocket, according to the insurance estimates.

I'm seriously considering saving up for it anyway and getting a tubal ligation now so I can at least stop Depo (I'm 4 months late on my shot but I haven't had a period so fingers crossed that whole ""it takes years for your body to recover"" thing is true). But then I will have to justify spending $3600 on an elective medical procedure when there are student loans to pay, and I really want to pay my student loans.

"Brought up being childfree with a friend today, and did not get the reaction I expected.","I [18F] live in a pretty liberal, and open minded place, and most of my friends share those ideals with me. I've known I've wanted to be childfree for pretty much my entire life. My mom knows it and supports the idea and a few of my close friends do as well. Ever since hearing about Planned Parenthood performing Essure on women over 18 with little to no hassel, I've been anxious to get the procedure done as I am 100% confident I never want children. 

Well my best friend [18F] recently came back after a long vacation and we were talking about new things in our lives. She told me that her family is adopting a child that her extended family can't take care of, if that makes any sense. Although it was ultimately her parents decision, she was the one pushing the decision. She lamented on the fact that this meant she wouldn't be getting her own car, wouldn't be able to join me backpacking across Europe next summer, wouldn't be able to go to university out of state like she had dreamed, and would most likely be living at home and going to community college. 

And then she said she was happy because she would be helping her family. Coming from a girl who's only dream was to get out of this town, it was crazy to listen to! She then went on to talk about how she can't wait to have kids of her own, and I casually brought up that I didn't think I would ever have kids and wanted to get Essure done in a few months when I had enough money saved. 

Big mistake, apparently. 

She started saying how I would regret it, how I would change my mind, how I would be a great mother (Totally untrue; I have zero patience for children, don't like them at all, was bad enough to get fired from a babysitting gig), and basically her rejecting my life choices. My favorite part was when she asked ""how are you supposed to be remembered?"" and reminded me of the post about leaving a legacy. This was hard enough coming from my best friend, so I just calmly stated the reasons I would be a shit mom, how I wanted to travel and have money and free time, how if you have to use breeding to be remembered your life wasn't worth much anyways, and how I wasn't sure if I even wanted to get married. 

I thought I outlined my goals and reasons why pretty neatly, and thought she would understand and accept my choices. Nope! Instead she went on about how it was okay I didn't want my own kids, and how I would be the best *adoptive* mother ever! Wat? I never once said anything about adopting kids, or *just* not wanting to go through pregnancy, but apparently I'm only afraid of the pain of childbirth and secretly want to have children. 

This whole thing was so frustrating to me. Not that I needed my best friend's blessing per se, but I was hoping for her to be the one to help me through the process of getting sterilized. Ever since I told her she's made it a point to say how good of an adoptive mother I would be, and other comments like that. It's so frustrating! She was the last person I would expect to make a fuss about my choices, but it turns out she's the one with the biggest problem. 

Oh well. I'm still going to get the procedure done in the near future and if she doesn't support me, I'll find somebody who does.

EDIT: Some explanation about why I added the story about my friend's family's adoption. It was just so weird to see somebody I actually know willingly throw their plans away in order to be involved with a child. Since she's an adult legally, I figured she would not be involved and go to a school out of state like she wanted, but instead is super enthusiastic about being involved in the adopted child's life. I didn't mean to sound like a bitch about it. It was just so sudden and weird to see it happening. And hearing about how she was giving up her dreams for a child that isn't even her's was reinforcement for me being childfree. Sorry for offending anyone, I guess?

EDIT II: I guess people aren't getting that my friend was a driving force for deciding whether or not to adopt. It wasn't as if her parents said ""we're adopting another child, deal with it.""

I [18F] live in a pretty liberal, and open minded place, and most of my friends share those ideals with me. I've known I've wanted to be childfree for pretty much my entire life. My mom knows it and supports the idea and a few of my close friends do as well. Ever since hearing about Planned Parenthood performing Essure on women over 18 with little to no hassel, I've been anxious to get the procedure done as I am 100% confident I never want children. 

Well my best friend [18F] recently came back after a long vacation and we were talking about new things in our lives. She told me that her family is adopting a child that her extended family can't take care of, if that makes any sense. Although it was ultimately her parents decision, she was the one pushing the decision. She lamented on the fact that this meant she wouldn't be getting her own car, wouldn't be able to join me backpacking across Europe next summer, wouldn't be able to go to university out of state like she had dreamed, and would most likely be living at home and going to community college. 

And then she said she was happy because she would be helping her family. Coming from a girl who's only dream was to get out of this town, it was crazy to listen to! She then went on to talk about how she can't wait to have kids of her own, and I casually brought up that I didn't think I would ever have kids and wanted to get Essure done in a few months when I had enough money saved. 

Big mistake, apparently. 

She started saying how I would regret it, how I would change my mind, how I would be a great mother (Totally untrue; I have zero patience for children, don't like them at all, was bad enough to get fired from a babysitting gig), and basically her rejecting my life choices. My favorite part was when she asked ""how are you supposed to be remembered?"" and reminded me of the post about leaving a legacy. This was hard enough coming from my best friend, so I just calmly stated the reasons I would be a shit mom, how I wanted to travel and have money and free time, how if you have to use breeding to be remembered your life wasn't worth much anyways, and how I wasn't sure if I even wanted to get married. 

I thought I outlined my goals and reasons why pretty neatly, and thought she would understand and accept my choices. Nope! Instead she went on about how it was okay I didn't want my own kids, and how I would be the best *adoptive* mother ever! Wat? I never once said anything about adopting kids, or *just* not wanting to go through pregnancy, but apparently I'm only afraid of the pain of childbirth and secretly want to have children. 

This whole thing was so frustrating to me. Not that I needed my best friend's blessing per se, but I was hoping for her to be the one to help me through the process of getting sterilized. Ever since I told her she's made it a point to say how good of an adoptive mother I would be, and other comments like that. It's so frustrating! She was the last person I would expect to make a fuss about my choices, but it turns out she's the one with the biggest problem. 

Oh well. I'm still going to get the procedure done in the near future and if she doesn't support me, I'll find somebody who does.

"Welcoming your stories and opinions on being CF and staying that way. (Come for the long story, stay to tell your own)","Backstory: I'm 24 years old, have been reasonably certain that I would like to be CF for a few years, with a few drops in common sense, each lasting less than an hour. I have serious issues with my menstrual cycle. The physical pain and heaviness keep me bedridden for three days each cycle, I get my period every two weeks and I bleed for ten days or more. Mentally, I’m a wreck. I go from outraged to sobbing in a split second. 


I have tried various Birth Control methods. The Pill wasn’t strong enough, or made me gain weight or break out. Implanon didn’t stop my periods; I just spotted fortnightly or at random. No nice knickers for me! I’ve had an IUD (Mirena) for two, nearly three years. My periods stopped briefly but now I am concerned because they’re getting heavier each month and my moods are haywire. There is no other factor or variable that has changed that could cause this. The other issue with the IUD is it makes certain sexual positions untenable due to his discomfort. As a sexual creature, I resent that. 


I’m speaking to a doctor at the Family Planning Clinic in three weeks. I’m gearing towards permanent birth control; Novasure and Essure. To put this into perspective; one of the best compliments I have ever received was being told that a family friend saw himself as my adoptive father because I was too much for just one dad. I was never a rebel, just stubborn, headstrong and prepared. I was also a nightmare for my mother, who is actually a wonderful parent and a lovely person. So I get what I want and I’ll be nice but firm about it. 



So I’m prepared to argue my way. I’m prepared to list the reasons of why I am making this choice (briefly here); 


•	I don’t want that lifestyle. Don’t tell me you can keep living like a crazy unattached person when you have a baby/toddler/child/teenager because we all know you cannot. Money gets funnelled into supporting this life you created with your squishy bits and so it should if that is what you chose to do.


•	I can take care of kids. I am not scared of them. I understand childbirth, pregnancy and the idea that you love something more than life itself. It does not appeal to me and I don’t think I should bring a child into this world without 100% sureness in my own mind, that I want it and I can take care of it. 


I won’t let a doctor’s personal opinions stop me. If they can come up with two medically-sound reasons that I should not be sterilised, I’ll listen. If they won’t do it because it violates their personal idea of how things should be, they will know exactly why and how I’m disappointed in them as professionals. 


I had a GP refer me to the clinic. He is young, Asian (Australian born and raised) and his first reaction was to blanche when I mentioned sterilisation. I cut him off before he could try and ‘dissuade’ me because I know my choices and life and body better than a doctor who has only just met me and hasn’t even asked WHY. 


He gave me the referral and I left. Now I’m gearing up to be polite and firm with 
the next set of medical professionals. 



I mentioned it to my boyfriend; he was apprehensive but I didn’t instigate a discussion on the topic yet. Why? We have been dating for four months. Yes, it’s serious but I’m waiting until after my appointment with the FP (in which I plan to discuss if the methods I have picked are medically suitable for my body and what the time frame would be), in order to present the facts and evidence. 

Then I have to ask him; do you see yourself having kids? Would you be okay if you never had children? Etc. etc. To note; we have talked about having families, he and I share the view that kids are nice, but he has said that he would not want to make that decision until he is 35 (he’s 28 now). I think he has always seen himself as a dad in the distant future. I plan on putting it to him; a future with me is childfree. I am not changing my mind on this. If he sees himself having kids, then he’s free to find someone to fulfil that dream with. I will be sad and I love him and it will suck for however long it takes me to get on with my life. 


I also think his understanding of what a woman has to go through in order to have a baby is severely lacking. I am hyperaware of the physical, mental and financial costs of reproducing. I am aware of how it affects couples and is more likely to end a marriage than repair it (side note; the thought that having a kid will save a lost cause boggles my tiny mind). I know what will happen each step of the way of the pregnancy and what babies do, for good or bad. I studied psychology, I understand development of the brain. I don’t think he sees it from a female perspective and I am going to have to explain that to him in order to explain why I’m choosing this. 


TL:DR I showed you mine, now show me yours. I want to know your journey into CF-dom. What made you choose, was it always a known factor, how did you ensure it? I WANT TO KNOW YOUR LIFE.

I got my Essure today!  AMA!  Story inside.,"Hi, everyone!  I finally got my Essure today!  It was a completely painless experience.  Because of the Affordable Care Act, every single aspect of it was 100% covered by my insurance.  Here is the scoop for interested parties from top to bottom:

I wasn't allowed to eat anything after midnight, nor drink any water after 5 AM.  I showed up at the doctor's office and filled out some general paperwork.  I was completely starving, so I was really excited to be put under so that I wouldn't be hungry anymore.  I managed to ignore it as much as possible as I waited, and then I was finally called back from the waiting room, where I filled out some more paperwork and answered some medical and insurance questions.  I was then taken back to give a urine sample for a pregnancy test. 

Once it was confirmed negative, they took a couple of vitals and then fitted with an IV.  I waited for a few moments, and the anesthesiologist showed up.  She gave me a cocktail of Fentanyl and Versed - one drug for the pain, and the other to block the formation of new memories.  Therefore, I began to feel a little fuzzy, and then I felt a wave of happiness wash over me, and I couldn't control myself from giggling.  My boyfriend asked me, ""So that's quite funny to you, is it?"" and I nodded.  

Then, what felt like three or four seconds later, I had a cup of ice chips and a spoon in my hand, and an ice pack on my stomach. I asked what the ice pack was for, and I was told that the procedure was all finished.  I took a few more minutes, maybe 15-20, to 'come out' of my druggedness and eat ice chips.  Then I had to go and pee to let everyone know that everything still worked properly, and then I got dressed and got wheeled out to my best friend's car.

We went and had burgers and ice cream, and then I got my prescription for Vicodin filled, but I honestly haven't needed it.  After the initial drugs wore off, I felt a bit of dull, light cramping in the abdomen - not unlike some of the more mild menstrual cramps I've had in the past.  I was also told that I might be nauseated, but I haven't had any problems with that, either.  

I have a two week follow up appointment, and I've been told not to have sex or use tampons until that time.  That is going to suck.  But everything went off without a hitch!

serrapeptase and autophagy effects with essure [purposeful scar tissue]?,"i have just begun taking serrapeptase, hoping for aid with a few diff things \[allergies, inflammation,  general clean up, etc\], but am curious if anyone thinks it might be detrimental to my birth control measures.

Some information about tubal ligation,"Hi all, 

I wanted to write this post as a physician who performs sterilization surgery. First of all, I want to let all of you out there who have had trouble getting this procedure done know that I believe you, and that I am sorry it is so hard to get access to adequate healthcare in this country (the US). Second, I wanted to make sure that for everyone who does want to get sterilization surgery to be adequately educated about what the typical procedures are, how they are performed, and what the risks/benefits are to each. I will also spend some time at the end discussing some reasons your doctor may be reluctant to perform the surgery for you (good reasons, not just because you haven't had kids yet). 

**First some** [anatomy](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/images/ency/fullsize/19263.jpg)

Some very basic stuff here. In the link above, you'll see a cross section of a uterus as if you're slicing it right down the middle from the top down. The ovaries, which are on either side in this diagram, have eggs within, and each month, usually one is released during ovulation. The egg will travel down toward the fallopian tube, where it may meet a sperm, and that is how pregnancy occurs. The idea behind sterilization surgery is to somehow physically block this from happening by occluding the fallopian tubes. 

**What does it mean to get my tubes tied?** 

This is trick question because there are many ways to ""get your tubes tied"" or sterilized, so to speak. Nothing, unfortunately is 100% preventative against pregnancy, but getting your tubes tied is pretty darn good. The average rate goes from about 99.1-99.9% depending on the method. 

What it does not mean: getting your tubes tied will not decrease your body's natural levels of estrogen. Most of the estrogen in your body is created in the ovary or in your fat cells. A small amount come from the adrenal glands. The tubes do not do this. Getting your tubes tied will not make your periods go away. Having a period is an entirely separate process that I may discuss later. 

1. **Tubal ligation** \- This is probably one of the most common ones to perform. This is when your surgeon takes out a portion of the tube, ties off both ends, burns both ends, or even just puts a clip (Filshe clip) or band around a portion of the tube. The idea is that because the two ends of the fallopian tube are no longer touching each other, the egg and sperm cannot get through. These procedures can be done in one of two ways: laparoscopically (with usually two or three 1-2 cm incisions and a camera that goes through the belly button) or open (with an incision on the lower part of your belly, usually about 4-6 cm long). This surgery can also be performed at the time of a Cesarean section or right after a vaginal delivery through an incision under the belly button (again, about 4-6 cm long). 
2. **Bilateral salpingectomy -** This is now becoming more and more popular because studies have shown that some ovarian cancers actually arise from the fallopian tube. This procedure involves physically removing both fallopian tubes. Again, this can be done laparoscopically or through an open incision. This is also the most effective form of avoiding pregnancy if we look at all forms of sterilization surgery. 
3. **Essure** \- Just thought I would mention this, even though it is no longer available in the US. Bayer, the company that makes Essure, stopped producing them at the end of 2018, and all unused units should have been returned at the end of 2019. Essentially, Essure was attractive because it could be done in the office instead of the operating room. It involves the placement of a camera into the cervix and uterus, with distention of the uterus using saline. The procedure then involved placing the Essure coils, which were made of copper, into the bilateral ostia (the opening where the fallopian tubes meet the uterus). This would cause the ostia to eventually scar over in a period of about 3 months, which would lead to occlusion of the tubes. People would need to get imaging called a hysterosalpingogram to make sure that the tubes were definitely closed before having unprotected intercourse. 

**What are the risks and benefits?** 

1. **Benefits:** This is a great way of preventing pregnancy without using hormonal birth control. It can really help ease the stress of remembering to take a pill, asking a partner to wear a condom, etc. Forms of sterilization that removes a portion of or the whole tube are also great ways to reduce your risk of ovarian cancer in the future, though I always say that this is just an added benefit -- we wouldn't recommend that people get their tubes removed for this purpose alone, unless you also have a strong family history of breast/ovarian cancer and have tested positive for certain gene mutations. Sterilization surgery is NOT good for helping with painful periods, heavy periods, or really anything else that doesn't have to do with what I listed above. 
2. **Risks** \- I tell my patients that every procedure has risks, just like everything else we do in life. Overall, the risks of getting sterilization surgery is small if you are overall healthy. However, it is surgery, and we do have to cut into your abdomen, so there are inherent risks there. I won't give actual numbers because this is individualized. These include: 
   1. Bleeding - A small amount of bleeding during surgery is unavoidable. Catastrophic bleeding that would require hospitalization or transfusion is rare and unlikely. Nevertheless, in our hospital, we always talk about risk of transfusion and if the patient is willing to have a blood transfusion to save their lives. We have this conversation now, because in case of an emergency, we know what to do. We can't wake you up during the middle of surgery to ask you. 
   2. Infection - There is a small risk of infection anytime we do anything under the skin. This risk is overall very tiny and we always use sterile technique. I tell everyone to look at their incision(s) periodically. If they are red, warm to the touch, or getting more painful, that is a reason to call your doctor. If you have fevers, chills, nausea/vomiting that develops for &gt;24 hours, also call your doctor. 
   3. Damage to other organs - We are cutting into your abdomen. Your tubes are surrounded by structures like your bowels, your ovaries, your uterus, your bladder. The risk of damaging any of these organs are very low. This risk goes up if you have had previous abdominal surgery and have had scarring inside the abdomen. The more surgeries in the belly you have, the more likely your anatomy inside is distorted and the harder future surgeries become. 
   4. Risk of anesthesia - People have different reactions to anesthesia. Any time we have to put someone to sleep and help them breathe with a tube, there is a small risk. I'm not an anesthesiologist, so you should discuss these risks with your anesthesiologist. Again, the risk is overall small but will depend on your medical issues and your overall health. 
   5. Regret - I always mention this one. I don't care what you have heard about tubal reversal surgeries, etc. I always tell my patients, ""Think of this as PERMANENT."" You have to be 100% you don't want any more kids in the future. Tubal reversal surgeries don't always work, are very expensive (think thousands of dollars), and are not covered by insurance. IVF is also usually not covered by insurance after tubal ligation (but check your insurance for this... it has been true for the two states that I have practiced in). The risk of regret can be as high as 20%. That's right: about 1/5 people regret having sterilization surgery. The risk is higher in those that are younger and who are not married. This doesn't mean that I'm not going to perform the surgery for you if you're 25 and single. But it also means that I'm going to do my duty as a doctor and tell you about all the other choices that are just as good as getting your tubes tied for pregnancy prevention (ie. like an IUD or a Nexplanon) before we go down the route of surgery.
   6. Failure of the surgery - Believe it or not, there are people who get pregnant after sterilization surgery. Very rarely, if you have a portion of the tube taken out, the two free ends can come back together. It doesn't happen often (&lt;1% of the time), but... it's possible. 

**Why won't my doctor do my sterilization surgery?** 

I mean, other than some people being very old school or just being dicks... here are some actual reasons why you may not have gotten your surgery. 

1. The pandemic - for a while, most elective surgeries were completely cancelled. (By elective, I mean surgeries that do not need to be completed now or within a certain time frame to save your life.) Whether or not your doctor is performing surgeries will depend on where you live and the hospital guidelines. Most places should be back to doing elective surgeries again, so please check with your doctor 
2. Your insurance - So this is definitely not a good reason to not do your sterilization surgery eventually. But, if you have public insurance like Medicare or Medicaid, the government mandates that you sign something called an MA-31 form 30 days prior to your sterilization surgery. This was created in response to the horrible things that happened to a lot of underserved people with public insurance previously in the United States. Some of them were forced to get sterilization surgery against their will or woke up after other surgeries like appendectomies with a sterilization surgery on top of it. By creating this form, it prevented people from being coerced into sterilization surgery. Unfortunately, as you can imagine, by putting in a 30 day wait period, this can also prevent certain people from getting a surgery they really want. 
3. Your health - I know I said that sterilization surgery is overall very low risk, but this changes if you have other health issues. Some reasons (not comprehensive) of why your doctors may not want to perform an elective surgery on you (and again, elective here means a surgery that if you don't get, won't kill you) may be because of: 
   1. Heart issues - If you have cardiac issues (murmurs, heart failure, congenital heart defects, etc), it may be more risky to put you under general anesthesia. The chance of something bad (like you not waking up or even dying) is higher than the general population. Your doctor may not be willing to take on that risk. Some forms of sterilization surgery can be done with local anesthesia, like an epidural. Check with your doctor if that is an option. 
   2. Lung issues - Same as above. 
   3. Previous abdominal surgery - This isn't usually a problem if you've had one or two laparoscopic surgeries. It will also depend on how your body heals. If you've had more than one surgery, your surgeon is going to do their homework and read the last operative report. If the last surgeon found a lot of scar tissue and found that you have a lot of adhesions, it may be more difficult to go back and do another surgery in your belly. The more scar tissue and adhesions, the higher chance of damaging surrounding structures or even of finding your tubes to begin with. 
   4. There are lots of other health reasons, but I won't list them all here... just know that sometimes your health can prevent your surgeon from wanting to do an elective surgery on you. 

I know that this is not a comprehensive guide, but I hope that it at least gives you an idea of what to expect and what your doctors are thinking when you approach them about getting sterilization surgery. I also have not discussed recovery, etc.

Possibly preggers after having Essure procedure done 6 years ago,"After I had my daughter 6 years ago I had the Essure placement done to sterilize me. When I had it done I had to do this whole song and dance where they said it wasn't reversible and very much so permanent as well as 100% effective... Welp, today the red river of doom is 5 days late now... Tomorrow I am taking the dive and going to pee on a stick... However, I am VERY nervous about having another baby. Not just the whole ""omg yet another one!?!?!"", but what my main concern is about the little springs. Can they hurt the baby while I'm pregnant, IF I am at all. I've done a bit of research and have found that there have been LOTS of women that conceive after having the Essure placement done. Also, with me being told the Essure placement was 100%, does anyone know what options I would have about a lawsuit?

Robotic LAVH today and feeling surprisingly good! With SURPRISE traveling Essure coils!,"My background: 45, 2 vaginal deliveries 20/23 years ago. Essure done in 2009. I am fairly fit although recent anemia made it tough to run. 

Last 4 years, feeling of heaviness, cramping, ovulation like pain. 2 years ago, cycles went overnight to 21-23 days from 28. Then last year, completely unpredictable - culminating in a 9 week long period that had me anemic from soaking a pad plus tampon in an hr for multiple weeks straight.

Got there today at 530. Checked in, gowned, urine sample (for a pregnancy test, wtf???) and back in anesthesia at 730. Came to in recovery around 10. Remember NOTHING. Then 2 hrs in post op observation, a trip to drugstore to get meds, greasy loaded fries, a little nap and I feel
GREAT. 

My low grade to moderate constant cramping ia gone. Poofy belly from gas but that is it. Pain theorized to be from my Essure, bc those little fucking coils migrated to and embedded IN MY UTERUS. Doc is pretty certain that was the cause. Well, no more! Kept ovaries too.

[FIX] Military spouse got approval!!!,"I'd love to post the doctor on the Wiki, but military doctors tend to move around, so there's no telling where my doctor will be next time someone tries to get a hold of her. If anyone else (needing a tubal) is on Okinawa and wants her name, PM me and I'll tell you! 

Now that that's out of the way. OMG YOU GUYS!!! With the other military folks/spouses posting on here about being turned down right away, I was worried. I knew about the appointment for roughly 2.5 weeks, so I was searching through this subreddit and getting all the information that I could about the logical and emotional ways to counteract every single thing a doctor could throw at me. I printed out a 4 page letter that was mostly bullets (I can either try to post it in the comments or just PM me and I'll send it to you) and several other studies, including the one regret study that differentiated between nulliparous and parous people with uteruses with that section about the mulliparous people highlighted.

I was so nervous once I got there, though. All the way until the doctor came in, and then my anxiety somehow turned into confidence.

But first, I was taken back by a nurse and asked the usual questions about my medical history, if I was taking any medication, if I was allergic to anything, what I was in for (sterilization), and if I had ever been pregnant before (not to my knowledge). Then he said he thought the doctor was currently seeing another patient and she would come in as soon as she was done.

Basically, our conversation (paraphrased because it's been a while and my memory for conversations isn't the best):

&gt; Doc: So are you okay with never having kids?
&gt; 
&gt; Me: Yup! I've never wanted kids my whole life, as long as I can remember. (Which is totally true, I've never remembered wanting kids or even liking other kids very much ever.)
&gt; 
&gt; Doc: Okay, well, there are two ways for permanent sterilization. One is laproscopy, which is surgery going through the belly button, and Essure.
&gt; 
&gt; Me: Which is currently being investigated by the FDA.
&gt; 
&gt; Doc: -laughs- Yeah, I see you've done some research. The two kinds of tubals we do are the clips and the removal of the whole tubes.
&gt; 
&gt; Me: I'll take the tube removal. There's a far less chance of recanalization that way!
&gt; 
&gt; Doc: -nods- Okay, we'll go with that one. When do you want it done?
&gt; 
&gt; Me: As soon as possible, preferably. 
&gt; 
&gt; Doc: Okay. I know all of my April dates are full, so I'll have to go look when I have available dates in May. I'll be right back. -leaves the room and then comes back- So I have May 4th and May 18th. They are both Wednesdays because that's the date I'm scheduled to do out patient surgeries.
&gt; 
&gt; Me: I have to have someone come pick me up, right?
&gt; 
&gt; Doc: That's correct.
&gt; 
&gt; Me: I'll do the 18th then. (My SO will be gone until mid May, and should hopefully be back before that date. I'm not really close to many of the other military people here on island, so I'd rather not ask them if I can help it.)
&gt; 
&gt; Doc: Okay, sounds good. Any other questions?
&gt; 
&gt; Me: Other than I was thinking I'd have to fight you for this?
&gt; 
&gt; Doc: Well, you seem to know what you want and you've done your research and know it's permanent, so I don't see why I would.
&gt; 
&gt; Me: Okay! No other questions that I can think of right now!
&gt; 
&gt; Doc: If you think of any more, write them down and bring them with you to the consultation. I can't do that more than 30 days out from the surgery, so you'll have to go back to the sign-in desk and get another appointment. They'll also give you the pre-op paperwork that you'll fill out and bring with you to the consultation. 
&gt; 
&gt; Me: Sounds good!

And then there was the making the pre-op consultation appointment for early May and I have the paperwork and I'm basically all set! I've basically been dancing around the house super giddy since the appointment.

"(SFW) Well, this happened at the gyno office [xpost from 2XC]","BACKSTORY:

When I got this job, the first thing I did with my fancy new health insurance was go see the gyno. I had not had insurance for about 13 years so I was super stoked and I was ready to get off the Pill and onto something more long term. My husband and I are not having kids (no, not ever) so I was looking into a tubal + ablation or Essure.

Long story short, the gyno was awesome about not having babies but admitted that her superiors required a lot of hoops to jump through for a patient in my situation who wanted permanent sterilization so we decided that the Mirena was the best option for me right now. Insurance covered it, it was easy to get and is just as effective as the permanent measures. I got the IUD a week later, it sucked for a day but otherwise not a big deal and we set up a time for me to come back in a month to check things out.

THE ACTUAL STORY:

At my one month checkup, I asked the receptionist if she knew if I'd be getting an ultrasound for the IUD. She did not know and asked me to tell her on my way out.

I went in for the checkup, everything was fine and we did not do an ultrasound. On my way out, it had gotten a bit more crowded and the receptionist was helping someone else so I just waved and kept walking. She saw me and called out ""Did you get the ultrasound?"" and I replied ""No, not today"" and she then said ""Oh well, maybe next time!"" and we said bye and I left.

I was waiting for the elevator with about 3-5 other people and a woman who had left right behind me walks up, places one hand on my shoulder and stands on the other side, effectively trapping me while she puts her other hand on my lower abdomen and coos ""Oh poor baby, they'll take your picture next time!"". I was frozen in shock at first but regained my senses enough to say (in a level-but-horrified voice) ""I'm not pregnant, I just got an IUD placed.""

Pause.

Recoil.

Withdraw.

She didn't even apologize, she just froze, stepped away and didn't look at me. I followed her into the elevator and she stood as far away as she could. Everyone else in the elevator was clearly feeling very awkward. As the doors closed, I lost it and started laughing.
