There are always risks, and it’s important to make informed choices. The recovery times vary as well, which is something to consider. There’s also costs associated with the procedures, and insurance doesn’t always cover everything. I’m not saying don’t, because it’s your choice. But if I had known about the side effects of Essure when I had it done (they weren’t well known when I had mine placed), I may have requested a different method. \\n\\nI’m happy to talk more about it with you if you want to get a more in depth perspective.

No GA required, it's normally in outpatients and you can leave the same day.\\n\\nJust wanted to ask the community if any of you have had it done, or know about it, and could tell me more?

All of the medical personnel who helped me were informative and did not challenge my desire to be sterilized.\\n\\n## Overview\\n\\n**Surgery**: Laparoscopic Bilateral Salpingectomy with a Mirena IUD replacement\\n\\n**Date of surgery**: Friday 14 May 2021 (5 days ago)\\n\\n**Total cost**: my $10 outpatient surgery co-pay, all else is covered by insurance\\n\\n**Surgeon**: [Dr. Gene De Haan](https://healthy.kaiserpermanente.org/oregon-washington/clinicians/gene-dehaan-3541258)\\n\\n**Recommended?** [Abso-lutely](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMnT4tp-cMk&amp;amp;ab_channel=AdultSwim).\\n\\n## Personal Stats\\n\\n**Location**: Portland, Oregon, USA\\n\\n**Age at time of surgery**: 28 years old\\n\\n**Healthcare Provider**: Kaiser Permanente\\n\\n**Pre-existing conditions**? None\\n\\n## Background and Initial Research\\n\\nI particularly appreciated reading [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/truechildfree/comments/m99ceb/got_sterilized_yesterday_19f/)  from this subreddit prior to my surgery for an idea of the experience. In fact, while I didn’t expect it to work, that did inspire me to ask to receive my Fallopian tubes after my surgery to keep as a macabre keepsake. My surgeon was amused, and said they had not received that request before. Unfortunately, this was not feasible as it would require a lot of paperwork because once they’re removed, they’re considered a biohazardous material and can’t just be released to me. They instead offered to provide me with pictures from the laparoscopy as a compromise which I happily accepted :)\\n\\nI also appreciated [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/truechildfree/comments/lzc5hz/my_covidera_sterilization_story_f_32_bilateral/) and have used it as a reference for some helpful content to cover.\\n\\nI didn’t read [this person’s BiSalp experience](https://www.girlvetica.com/home/2017/10/5/my-sterilization-experience-part-1) until after surgery, but it is also a great read.\\n\\nWhen I was initially considering female sterilization (before I had spent much time here) I did some reading before calling up Kaiser to ask about options. Bilateral Salpingectomy was not emphasized online, and most resources I found focused on Tubal Ligation, so that’s what I went in expecting to be recommended. I came in with questions like “does ligation vs implant (Essure) have a higher success rate / fewer complications” and “is Tubal Ligation Pain Syndrome real?” Well, after a discussion with the gynecologist I was referred to, it became clear that Laparoscopic Bilateral Salpingectomy is the gold standard in terms of minimal complications, success rate, and [reducing the risk of Ovarian Cancer](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5865096/). “Fuck yeah, sounds awesome!” I thought, “Cut me up already!” I do recall being annoyed that the hits I received when researching female sterilization focused primarily on tubal ligation, with Planned Parenthood being one of the few resources that even mentioned salpingectomy. I wish I had known about this subreddit sooner.\\n\\n## Cost of Surgery\\n\\nIf you are a member of Kaiser, they have a cost estimator [here](https://www.thconsumeradvantage.com/tcc2/librarian/PFActionId/tcc2.mainpage#!/home). However, because This Is America and healthcare navigation is perpetually in the technological past, they don’t even have estimates for every surgical procedure, including BiSalp. Best estimate I could get was for a hysteroscopic tubal ligation which came out to *$0 out-of-pocket* and *\\~$4,000 covered by insurance*. “Great if true,” I figured. A hand-wavey estimate is better than nothing but not by much.\\n\\n## Paid Medical Leave\\n\\nOnce my surgery was scheduled, I began the process for obtaining paid medical leave via FMLA. (“Family Medical Leave Act” for folks outside the USA) I had to read an introductory letter from my benefits company, call up Kaiser to fill out a “release of information” or ROI, sign and submit a paid leave and benefits agreement, and file for short-term disability benefits. The ROI part was a little dicey because of the relatively short time frame in which the Leave and Disability Management company needed the form, longer turnaround times due to COVID, and my reluctance to receive a medical document via email, notoriously insecure. (The latter concern ended up being addressed.)\\n\\nAfter all the paperwork, I received **2 weeks of paid medical leave**.\\n\\n## Pre-op discussions with my healthcare provider\\n\\nMy first call with Kaiser was on **12 March 2021** (with a Physician’s Assistant) and **by 16 March 2021 I had met with the referred Gynecologist and my surgery was scheduled**. As you can tell from the dates, it was scheduled for \\~2 months out. I recall knowing from the latter visit that I should expect a pre-op appointment, but actually **there were 3 pre-ops** (which initially surprised/confused me): one with my surgeon to cover surgery details, one with a nurse to cover preparation for surgery and reasons after surgery to return to the hospital (e.g. 100.4+ Fahrenheit fever, excessive bleeding, chest pain, vomiting, pain in back of knee indicating blood clot, etc.), and a third one to again discuss preparations for surgery such as what to stop  (no herbal supplements or NSAIDs so goodbye CBDoobs, no drinking, no melatonin, and no Valerian Root 7 days beforehand; also no shaving 2 days beforehand), what drugs to pick up beforehand, when to stop eating (no solid foods 8+ hours before surgery time), and when to stop drinking (nothing but water, coffee without creamer, tea, or apple juice between 8 and 2 hours beforehand, after which point, nothing). I was also instructed to chug 8 ounces of gatorade 2 hours and 15mins before my surgery time to help with recovery after surgery.\\n\\nPrior to these early appointments regarding sterilization, I prepped talking points about why I wanted to be sterilized despite having no children. I planned to steamroll through healthcare providers’ concerns if need be, and go on the offensive if they asked what my partner thought for example, or covered any of the stupid-ass Bingo talking points. Thankfully, and appropriately, none of that was necessary. Every healthcare provider was supportive and entirely receptive to my certainty that I wished to be sterilized. That made me feel safe, supported, and respected :)\\n\\n## Pre-op preparation\\n\\nIn addition to the aforementioned 3 pre-op phone appointments, I had to go in for a **COVID-19 test** between 2 - 5 days before my surgery and **get bloodwork done at least 1 week before my surgery** (actually I got it done 5 days beforehand shhhh). The COVID-19 test was a nasal swab that tickled and made me sneeze. I was prescribed a **scopolamine patch** to affix to bare skin behind an ear 24+ hours prior to surgery to reduce/prevent nausea due to anesthesia. The scopolamine patch is effective for up to 3 days and could be taken off after 24 hours had passed since surgery. I recommend not putting the patch on unnecessarily early, as the side effects I experienced were unpleasant: I gained short-range blurry vision, which prevented me from passing time reading for a while after surgery. I felt disoriented and dizzy the morning of surgery, I felt like I was experiencing the world through a haze, and I felt dissociated from my surroundings. I described my dissociation to my partner in the car on the way to the hospital, and he said that my description reminded him of how he felt on some depression medications he’s taken. Most of these were listed as side-effects of the scopolamine patch in the paperwork that came with the medication, so I wasn’t worried by any of it, but it was overall off-putting.\\n\\nOther drugs/stuff I picked up beforehand, most of them instructed by my doctor: a **stool softener** (Life Line docusate sodium, over-the-counter), a **laxative** (Senna Lax, over-the-counter), an **opioid** (hydrocodone, 6 tablets, prescription), **acetaminophen** (over-the-counter), **ibuprofen** (over-the-counter), **gatorades** (stay hydrated / boost glycogen / yummy sugar), **ice packs** (reduce swelling at incision sites), a **thermometer** (identify fever), **maxi pads** (for managing vaginal bleeding), and I asked my partner to get me some tasty treats so he came home with lemon pound cake and salted caramel chocolate truffles. He’s a good noodle. :)\\n\\nI cleaned all our bedding and vacuumed the night before so I’d have a clean area to convalesce. As instructed by my medical team, I prepared my skin the night before surgery using the 2% chlorohexidine gluconate antiseptic wipes they had mailed me a few weeks prior. I performed a similar wipe down the morning of surgery. This inhibits bacterial growth on the skin, reducing the chance of infection after surgery.\\n\\nI also own a German shepherd dog, and while he normally sleeps with us, he was not invited to do so the first few nights after surgery. Our cats still slept with us, in part because one of them is an asshole who will scream all night and body slam our bedroom door if we lock her out.\\n\\nKaiser also supplies all this “Enhanced Recovery After Surgery” or ERAS info to, as expected, aid recovery following surgery. **TL;DR** walk ASAP after surgery to reduce the chance of blood clots, perform breathing exercises / cough lightly each hour while conscious to prevent pneumonia and atelectasis (you might get an incentive spirometer to help with this), eat regularly to give your body energy to heal, and it’s important to poop ASAP so walk / drink fluids / take laxatives and stool softeners / become a hoover for fibrous foods.\\n\\nI also added some reminders to my Google calendar for things like when to take each of my drugs, when to practice breathing exercises, when to call the hospital if I haven’t pooped yet, and when to remove the scopolamine patch. I knew these would be estimated times at best, but I wanted reminders to at least pop up on my phone for these things so I didn’t have to try to remember them.\\n\\nI definitely recommend front-loading all this preparatory work. That meant while I was healing from surgery, I didn’t have to remember or focus on anything but healing.\\n\\n## Surgery\\n\\nMy surgery was scheduled for 12:30. In the morning I had black coffee and chugged a gatorade at 10:15. I wore a comfy nylon / spandex yoga bra, unisex underwear, sweatpants, and an oversized shirt. I took out all my piercings and brought a book with me, The Wind in the Willows. My partner took the day off work to drive me to/from, and it’s good he did, because it turned out to be an all-day affair. (We didn’t get home until \\~9pm)\\n\\nWe arrived \\~15mins early. We ended up having to wait for close to an hour after arriving as they were running behind. Once they called me back, they had my partner leave because COVID. I was given a medical mask to replace my cloth one. During this time and over the course of the day, I was asked a gazillion times to repeat my name and birth date. They took me to a back room with many people in hospital beds surrounded by curtains that kind of simulated cubicles, all of them against the walls. They asked if I needed to use the toilet then had me change into a hospital gown, some large, soft socks, and a hairnet. They gave me a large, clear, plastic bag to store my stuff. Initially I tied my gown together in the back, but two different nurses mentioned that getting in/out of bed is easier without the gown tied, and one of them untied it for me. I figured, ok, whatever, I’m sure many other bare asses have haunted these halls so I’ll leave mine open too.\\n\\nThey took my vitals, a nurse inserted an IV which stung, and they put sticky heart monitoring pads on parts of my upper body. It’s obvious I don’t like needles inserted, so the nurse kindly put a hot pack on the insertion site and that helped a ton! I barely felt the needle at that point. The nurse had me read over brief paperwork, my main memory of which was seeing confirmation of the procedures (it was actually 3 things: BiSalp, Mirena replacement, and a Pap smear because “might as well”) and me signing my name.\\n\\nLater, the anesthesiologist showed up, gave a brief overview of what would happen, asked if I had ever experienced side effects to anesthesia, and asked if I had questions. My main concern was that I wanted confirmation that I would be knocked out before anything else happened (like intubation or catheter insertion) and they confirmed that yes, I would be knocked out before anything else happened. This meeting was brief.\\n\\nLater on, a different nurse came in to check on me. They also confirmed that I’d been waiting so long, a shift change had occurred.\\n\\nAround 4/4:30p, my surgeon, Dr. De Haan, showed up and apologized for the wait. I was like /shrug, I get it, good health care doesn’t always stick to a schedule. They repeated what procedures I would be undergoing and asked if I’d already filled out the paperwork from earlier. While now I can recall that I did fill out paperwork, at the time I was very confused and drowsy and said that I didn’t think I had. My surgeon offered to check on this and asked if I had any questions. I did not and I think I said that I was ready to be cut open.\\n\\nShortly after this, I was moved to another nearby cubicle which it turns out is the cubicle I ended up recovering in.  I met my new, post-shift-change anesthesiologist. This meeting was brief and basically amounted to “Hi, I’m now the person who will knock you out with a chemical cocktail.” It was nice to meet everyone working on my body, even if briefly.\\n\\nAfter this, it was time, so a nurse came to move me to the operating room. It was kind of fun being casually scooted through the medical halls, and I pretended to be in a slow game of Need For Speed. They pushed me into the surgical room, pressed a lever to elevate me further, and helped me transfer myself to the operating table. There was A LOT of medical shit in this room. Screens flashing, a giant-ass TV hovering in front of me, like 6-7 medical personnel, tables and cupboards, various electronic devices, a giant alien-space-ship-looking light above me. It was a lot to take in. One of the nurses asked if I wanted to know what anything was so I asked questions, but was too overstimulated to remember anything they explained.  The anesthesiologist had hooked me up to something and I could (just barely) feel something being pumped in. I started counting and got up to 10, then decided there was no way it was anesthesia if I was still conscious for that long. I asked the nurse if it was expected that I be feeling dizzy all of a sudden and they confirmed that yes, that was expected. I don’t recall when, but at some point some warm, fabric sleeves were attached to my legs that massaged them to reduce the chance of blood clots.\\n\\nOnce Dr. De Haan arrived, in short order things happened: I think Dr. De Haan mentioned what procedure we were doing, an oxygen mask was put over my face, I breathed in a few times, I looked around a bit, and then: I woke up in the recovery room, groggy, stiff, and reluctant to move.\\n\\nA nurse came over to me. I don’t remember these interactions well, but I do know she called my partner to come get me. I also have these text transcripts between my partner and I at the time:\\n\\n&amp;gt;**me**: Hi  \\n&amp;gt;  \\n&amp;gt;**me**: I’m awake  \\n&amp;gt;  \\n&amp;gt;**me**: So groggy  \\n&amp;gt;  \\n&amp;gt;**partner**: Yay!  \\n&amp;gt;  \\n&amp;gt;**partner**: hi  \\n&amp;gt;  \\n&amp;gt;**partner**: &amp;lt;sends a creepy greeting sticker&amp;gt;  \\n&amp;gt;  \\n&amp;gt;**partner**: I’m expecting a call soon to come get you.  \\n&amp;gt;  \\n&amp;gt;**me**: This is so wack  \\n&amp;gt;  \\n&amp;gt;**me**: They’re feeding me ice chips\\n\\nMy abdomen was sore and my throat was especially sore and dry, but I noticed these things as though someone else was experiencing them.\\n\\nThe nurse helped me change back into my regular clothing and wheelchaired me down to the pickup area. I do not recall being required to pee before leaving, but this period of time is not well remembered. She and my partner helped load me into the passenger seat with some hospital ice packs over my bandage-covered incision sites, a powerade drink awaiting me, and a puke bag shoved into my hand. I was pretty uncoordinated during all this. I don’t recall the ride home much, but I do remember thinking that it was much more pleasant than I expected — maybe because the route we took home was mostly smooth freeway?\\n\\nOnce home, my partner made me steel cut oats with berries and a little bit of brown sugar. Apparently I ate half of this, took an oxycodone + stool softener + laxatives, then passed out in bed. I do not recall any of this.\\n\\n## Recovery\\n\\n**Day 1 highlights**\\n\\n* I ate more than the recommended daily dose of fiber for women my age. (32.5g total) Lots of oats, berries, fruits, pumpkin seeds, a fiber supplement, hemp seed hearts, coffee, spinach, figs, carrots, leaks, farro, and tons of water.\\n* My throat was massively fucking sore. I drank some tea with lemon and honey to try to help. I think the oxycodone helped quite a bit here.\\n* If I went too long without the oxy, I would start to feel sharp pains at the incision sites. So, the opioid was clearly helping with the abdominal pain too.\\n* It was very painful to breath deeply. The documentation from Kaiser made it clear that despite it being painful, it was very important that I practice breathing deeply and coughing (also hard because I couldn’t really use my abdomen muscles). So I did deep breathing exercises and coughed lightly every hour while awake the first couple days.\\n* I did not poop all day and felt very bloated by the end of the day.\\n* By the end of the first day after surgery, I had taken (according to Kaiser's recommendations) 7 laxatives since surgery, 3 stool softeners, had drank 100oz+ of water, had plenty of fiber, had stood up and walked a bit every hour, and had taken 2 oxycodone.\\n* There was periodic vaginal spotting. I wore a couple maxi pads.\\n* I did not experience pain while urinating despite the catheter placed during surgery.\\n* I did not experience shoulder or any other pain attributable to the gas they fill your abdomen with during surgery.\\n* I got to experience exactly how many casual movements engage my abdominal muscles, and how awkward these things become when you can’t use these muscles.\\n\\n**Day 2 highlights**\\n\\n* I woke up at 04:30am to possibly the worst cramps of my life. I was in so much pain, I was reduced to having one desire: escape from the pain. For \\~40 minutes the cramps came and went. I would get up, stumble to the bathroom, pace around the room in misery, sit on the toilet, nothing would come out, the cramps would reduce, I’d stumble back to bed and curl up for \\~2mins until the next wave of cramps came. This was a truly miserable time.\\n* Then from 05:10 - 06:20 I became a literal One Woman Shit Show. A human fecal hosepipe. It started with tiny poops and ended in explosive diarrhea. I shit 6 times over this time frame, drank a little water, then finally passed back out (with cramps reduced) at 06:20.\\n* I woke up again around 10:00 and shit another 5 times over the course of the morning. I was getting a bit worried about dehydrating/losing nutrition, so I drank some water and gatorade and nibbled some peanuts and toast.\\n* I felt so sad and pathetic and overall not good from all that, and was so frightened of going through it again, that I have not touched the oxycodone since then. (Since the opioid has the side effect of constipation)\\n\\nIn fact my discomfort has been manageable and i've continued pooping (but regularly) since The Day 2 Diarrhea Sufferfest, so I haven’t taken anything — opioid, NSAID, laxative, or stool softener. I’ll take an NSAID if I need to, but largely feel ok.\\n\\n**Day 3 and beyond highlights**\\n\\n* sore throat cleared up\\n* breathing became noticeably less painful and now feels normal\\n* light cramps continue, barely noticeable\\n* some abdominal tenderness remains\\n* still some spotting\\n\\n## My Surgeon\\n\\nDr. Gene De Haan? The best. They were thorough and patient in answering all my questions, were entirely receptive to my desire to be sterilized, and overall made me feel respected and safe. They also seem to have done a great job on my surgery as my side effects and pain have been entirely manageable. I poked into their “About Me” section on KP.org and they mention that:\\n\\n&amp;gt;My primary interest is LGBTQ health, with a focus in trans care…I am also committed to partnering with community members to dismantle racism, classism, ableism, homophobia, transphobia, misogyny, fatphobia, and other systems of oppression that exclude people from accessing care.\\n\\nAnd I have even more respect for them knowing how dedicated they are to providing inclusive and accessible healthcare and their interest in serving our historically underserved trans friends. So Dr. De Haan is also a very good noodle, and if you’re in the Portland, Oregon area and need an OB-GYN doc, I recommend them. I am lucky that I was referred to such an excellent surgeon, as I didn't need to do any legwork to find one that would respect my choice to be sterilized.\\n\\n## Closing thoughts\\n\\n* Outside of the day 2 shit-fest, pain has been entirely manageable and I feel like this was an easy surgery to bounce back from -- keeping in mind my age and general good health.\\n* There was a lot of scheduling and preparation to do beforehand as well as things to do / remember, but Kaiser and my healthcare team took on a lot of this burden. I am really grateful for everyone at Kaiser who helped me.\\n* Knowing I would be under general anesthesia eased much of my anxiety.\\n* I am lucky to be a back sleeper, because lying on my sides and stomach have both been uncomfortable on the incision sites.\\n* I got my Mirena renewed rather than removed because Mirena makes my period cramps and bleeding nearly non-existent. I realize BiSalp is basically 100% chance of successful sterilization.\\n* Mirena IUD is so good at preventing pregnancy, that I don’t feel dramatically safer against immediate pregnancy now vs prior to the surgery. However, I do feel a sense of relief that regardless of where reproductive healthcare in the U.S. goes, and regardless of where *I* go in my life, my chance of pregnancy will always and forever be effectively zero.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Howdy. I’ve read a number of folks’ experiences here in getting sterilized and figured I’d add my own. Overall: very positive, affirming experience! All of the medical personnel who helped me were informative and did not challenge my desire to be sterilized.\\n\\n## Overview\\n\\n**Surgery**: Laparoscopic Bilateral Salpingectomy with a Mirena IUD replacement\\n\\n**Date of surgery**: Friday 14 May 2021 (5 days ago)\\n\\n**Total cost**: my $10 outpatient surgery co-pay, all else is covered by insurance\\n\\n**Surgeon**: [Dr. Gene De Haan](https://healthy.kaiserpermanente.org/oregon-washington/clinicians/gene-dehaan-3541258)\\n\\n**Recommended?** [Abso-lutely](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMnT4tp-cMk&amp;amp;ab_channel=AdultSwim).\\n\\n## Personal Stats\\n\\n**Location**: Portland, Oregon, USA\\n\\n**Age at time of surgery**: 28 years old\\n\\n**Healthcare Provider**: Kaiser Permanente\\n\\n**Pre-existing conditions**? None\\n\\n## Background and Initial Research\\n\\nI particularly appreciated reading [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/truechildfree/comments/m99ceb/got_sterilized_yesterday_19f/)  from this subreddit prior to my surgery for an idea of the experience. In fact, while I didn’t expect it to work, that did inspire me to ask to receive my Fallopian tubes after my surgery to keep as a macabre keepsake. My surgeon was amused, and said they had not received that request before. Unfortunately, this was not feasible as it would require a lot of paperwork because once they’re removed, they’re considered a biohazardous material and can’t just be released to me. They instead offered to provide me with pictures from the laparoscopy as a compromise which I happily accepted :)\\n\\nI also appreciated [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/truechildfree/comments/lzc5hz/my_covidera_sterilization_story_f_32_bilateral/) and have used it as a reference for some helpful content to cover.\\n\\nI didn’t read [this person’s BiSalp experience](https://www.girlvetica.com/home/2017/10/5/my-sterilization-experience-part-1) until after surgery, but it is also a great read.\\n\\nWhen I was initially considering female sterilization (before I had spent much time here) I did some reading before calling up Kaiser to ask about options. Bilateral Salpingectomy was not emphasized online, and most resources I found focused on Tubal Ligation, so that’s what I went in expecting to be recommended. I came in with questions like “does ligation vs implant (Essure) have a higher success rate / fewer complications” and “is Tubal Ligation Pain Syndrome real?” Well, after a discussion with the gynecologist I was referred to, it became clear that Laparoscopic Bilateral Salpingectomy is the gold standard in terms of minimal complications, success rate, and [reducing the risk of Ovarian Cancer](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5865096/). “Fuck yeah, sounds awesome!” I thought, “Cut me up already!” I do recall being annoyed that the hits I received when researching female sterilization focused primarily on tubal ligation, with Planned Parenthood being one of the few resources that even mentioned salpingectomy. I wish I had known about this subreddit sooner.\\n\\n## Cost of Surgery\\n\\nIf you are a member of Kaiser, they have a cost estimator [here](https://www.thconsumeradvantage.com/tcc2/librarian/PFActionId/tcc2.mainpage#!/home). However, because This Is America and healthcare navigation is perpetually in the technological past, they don’t even have estimates for every surgical procedure, including BiSalp. Best estimate I could get was for a hysteroscopic tubal ligation which came out to *$0 out-of-pocket* and *\\~$4,000 covered by insurance*. “Great if true,” I figured. A hand-wavey estimate is better than nothing but not by much.\\n\\n## Paid Medical Leave\\n\\nOnce my surgery was scheduled, I began the process for obtaining paid medical leave via FMLA. (“Family Medical Leave Act” for folks outside the USA) I had to read an introductory letter from my benefits company, call up Kaiser to fill out a “release of information” or ROI, sign and submit a paid leave and benefits agreement, and file for short-term disability benefits. The ROI part was a little dicey because of the relatively short time frame in which the Leave and Disability Management company needed the form, longer turnaround times due to COVID, and my reluctance to receive a medical document via email, notoriously insecure. (The latter concern ended up being addressed.)\\n\\nAfter all the paperwork, I received **2 weeks of paid medical leave**.\\n\\n## Pre-op discussions with my healthcare provider\\n\\nMy first call with Kaiser was on **12 March 2021** (with a Physician’s Assistant) and **by 16 March 2021 I had met with the referred Gynecologist and my surgery was scheduled**. As you can tell from the dates, it was scheduled for \\~2 months out. I recall knowing from the latter visit that I should expect a pre-op appointment, but actually **there were 3 pre-ops** (which initially surprised/confused me): one with my surgeon to cover surgery details, one with a nurse to cover preparation for surgery and reasons after surgery to return to the hospital (e.g. 100.4+ Fahrenheit fever, excessive bleeding, chest pain, vomiting, pain in back of knee indicating blood clot, etc.), and a third one to again discuss preparations for surgery such as what to stop  (no herbal supplements or NSAIDs so goodbye CBDoobs, no drinking, no melatonin, and no Valerian Root 7 days beforehand; also no shaving 2 days beforehand), what drugs to pick up beforehand, when to stop eating (no solid foods 8+ hours before surgery time), and when to stop drinking (nothing but water, coffee without creamer, tea, or apple juice between 8 and 2 hours beforehand, after which point, nothing). I was also instructed to chug 8 ounces of gatorade 2 hours and 15mins before my surgery time to help with recovery after surgery.\\n\\nPrior to these early appointments regarding sterilization, I prepped talking points about why I wanted to be sterilized despite having no children. I planned to steamroll through healthcare providers’ concerns if need be, and go on the offensive if they asked what my partner thought for example, or covered any of the stupid-ass Bingo talking points. Thankfully, and appropriately, none of that was necessary. Every healthcare provider was supportive and entirely receptive to my certainty that I wished to be sterilized. That made me feel safe, supported, and respected :)\\n\\n## Pre-op preparation\\n\\nIn addition to the aforementioned 3 pre-op phone appointments, I had to go in for a **COVID-19 test** between 2 - 5 days before my surgery and **get bloodwork done at least 1 week before my surgery** (actually I got it done 5 days beforehand shhhh). The COVID-19 test was a nasal swab that tickled and made me sneeze. I was prescribed a **scopolamine patch** to affix to bare skin behind an ear 24+ hours prior to surgery to reduce/prevent nausea due to anesthesia. The scopolamine patch is effective for up to 3 days and could be taken off after 24 hours had passed since surgery. I recommend not putting the patch on unnecessarily early, as the side effects I experienced were unpleasant: I gained short-range blurry vision, which prevented me from passing time reading for a while after surgery. I felt disoriented and dizzy the morning of surgery, I felt like I was experiencing the world through a haze, and I felt dissociated from my surroundings. I described my dissociation to my partner in the car on the way to the hospital, and he said that my description reminded him of how he felt on some depression medications he’s taken. Most of these were listed as side-effects of the scopolamine patch in the paperwork that came with the medication, so I wasn’t worried by any of it, but it was overall off-putting.\\n\\nOther drugs/stuff I picked up beforehand, most of them instructed by my doctor: a **stool softener** (Life Line docusate sodium, over-the-counter), a **laxative** (Senna Lax, over-the-counter), an **opioid** (hydrocodone, 6 tablets, prescription), **acetaminophen** (over-the-counter), **ibuprofen** (over-the-counter), **gatorades** (stay hydrated / boost glycogen / yummy sugar), **ice packs** (reduce swelling at incision sites), a **thermometer** (identify fever), **maxi pads** (for managing vaginal bleeding), and I asked my partner to get me some tasty treats so he came home with lemon pound cake and salted caramel chocolate truffles. He’s a good noodle. :)\\n\\nI cleaned all our bedding and vacuumed the night before so I’d have a clean area to convalesce. As instructed by my medical team, I prepared my skin the night before surgery using the 2% chlorohexidine gluconate antiseptic wipes they had mailed me a few weeks prior. I performed a similar wipe down the morning of surgery. This inhibits bacterial growth on the skin, reducing the chance of infection after surgery.\\n\\nI also own a German shepherd dog, and while he normally sleeps with us, he was not invited to do so the first few nights after surgery. Our cats still slept with us, in part because one of them is an asshole who will scream all night and body slam our bedroom door if we lock her out.\\n\\nKaiser also supplies all this “Enhanced Recovery After Surgery” or ERAS info to, as expected, aid recovery following surgery. **TL;DR** walk ASAP after surgery to reduce the chance of blood clots, perform breathing exercises / cough lightly each hour while conscious to prevent pneumonia and atelectasis (you might get an incentive spirometer to help with this), eat regularly to give your body energy to heal, and it’s important to poop ASAP so walk / drink fluids / take laxatives and stool softeners / become a hoover for fibrous foods.\\n\\nI also added some reminders to my Google calendar for things like when to take each of my drugs, when to practice breathing exercises, when to call the hospital if I haven’t pooped yet, and when to remove the scopolamine patch. I knew these would be estimated times at best, but I wanted reminders to at least pop up on my phone for these things so I didn’t have to try to remember them.\\n\\nI definitely recommend front-loading all this preparatory work. That meant while I was healing from surgery, I didn’t have to remember or focus on anything but healing.\\n\\n## Surgery\\n\\nMy surgery was scheduled for 12:30. In the morning I had black coffee and chugged a gatorade at 10:15. I wore a comfy nylon / spandex yoga bra, unisex underwear, sweatpants, and an oversized shirt. I took out all my piercings and brought a book with me, The Wind in the Willows. My partner took the day off work to drive me to/from, and it’s good he did, because it turned out to be an all-day affair. (We didn’t get home until \\~9pm)\\n\\nWe arrived \\~15mins early. We ended up having to wait for close to an hour after arriving as they were running behind. Once they called me back, they had my partner leave because COVID. I was given a medical mask to replace my cloth one. During this time and over the course of the day, I was asked a gazillion times to repeat my name and birth date. They took me to a back room with many people in hospital beds surrounded by curtains that kind of simulated cubicles, all of them against the walls. They asked if I needed to use the toilet then had me change into a hospital gown, some large, soft socks, and a hairnet. They gave me a large, clear, plastic bag to store my stuff. Initially I tied my gown together in the back, but two different nurses mentioned that getting in/out of bed is easier without the gown tied, and one of them untied it for me. I figured, ok, whatever, I’m sure many other bare asses have haunted these halls so I’ll leave mine open too.\\n\\nThey took my vitals, a nurse inserted an IV which stung, and they put sticky heart monitoring pads on parts of my upper body. It’s obvious I don’t like needles inserted, so the nurse kindly put a hot pack on the insertion site and that helped a ton! I barely felt the needle at that point. The nurse had me read over brief paperwork, my main memory of which was seeing confirmation of the procedures (it was actually 3 things: BiSalp, Mirena replacement, and a Pap smear because “might as well”) and me signing my name.\\n\\nLater, the anesthesiologist showed up, gave a brief overview of what would happen, asked if I had ever experienced side effects to anesthesia, and asked if I had questions. My main concern was that I wanted confirmation that I would be knocked out before anything else happened (like intubation or catheter insertion) and they confirmed that yes, I would be knocked out before anything else happened. This meeting was brief.\\n\\nLater on, a different nurse came in to check on me. They also confirmed that I’d been waiting so long, a shift change had occurred.\\n\\nAround 4/4:30p, my surgeon, Dr. De Haan, showed up and apologized for the wait. I was like /shrug, I get it, good health care doesn’t always stick to a schedule. They repeated what procedures I would be undergoing and asked if I’d already filled out the paperwork from earlier. While now I can recall that I did fill out paperwork, at the time I was very confused and drowsy and said that I didn’t think I had. My surgeon offered to check on this and asked if I had any questions. I did not and I think I said that I was ready to be cut open.\\n\\nShortly after this, I was moved to another nearby cubicle which it turns out is the cubicle I ended up recovering in.  I met my new, post-shift-change anesthesiologist. This meeting was brief and basically amounted to “Hi, I’m now the person who will knock you out with a chemical cocktail.” It was nice to meet everyone working on my body, even if briefly.\\n\\nAfter this, it was time, so a nurse came to move me to the operating room. It was kind of fun being casually scooted through the medical halls, and I pretended to be in a slow game of Need For Speed. They pushed me into the surgical room, pressed a lever to elevate me further, and helped me transfer myself to the operating table. There was A LOT of medical shit in this room. Screens flashing, a giant-ass TV hovering in front of me, like 6-7 medical personnel, tables and cupboards, various electronic devices, a giant alien-space-ship-looking light above me. It was a lot to take in. One of the nurses asked if I wanted to know what anything was so I asked questions, but was too overstimulated to remember anything they explained.  The anesthesiologist had hooked me up to something and I could (just barely) feel something being pumped in. I started counting and got up to 10, then decided there was no way it was anesthesia if I was still conscious for that long. I asked the nurse if it was expected that I be feeling dizzy all of a sudden and they confirmed that yes, that was expected. I don’t recall when, but at some point some warm, fabric sleeves were attached to my legs that massaged them to reduce the chance of blood clots.\\n\\nOnce Dr. De Haan arrived, in short order things happened: I think Dr. De Haan mentioned what procedure we were doing, an oxygen mask was put over my face, I breathed in a few times, I looked around a bit, and then: I woke up in the recovery room, groggy, stiff, and reluctant to move.\\n\\nA nurse came over to me. I don’t remember these interactions well, but I do know she called my partner to come get me. I also have these text transcripts between my partner and I at the time:\\n\\n&amp;gt;**me**: Hi  \\n&amp;gt;  \\n&amp;gt;**me**: I’m awake  \\n&amp;gt;  \\n&amp;gt;**me**: So groggy  \\n&amp;gt;  \\n&amp;gt;**partner**: Yay!  \\n&amp;gt;  \\n&amp;gt;**partner**: hi  \\n&amp;gt;  \\n&amp;gt;**partner**: &amp;lt;sends a creepy greeting sticker&amp;gt;  \\n&amp;gt;  \\n&amp;gt;**partner**: I’m expecting a call soon to come get you.  \\n&amp;gt;  \\n&amp;gt;**me**: This is so wack  \\n&amp;gt;  \\n&amp;gt;**me**: They’re feeding me ice chips\\n\\nMy abdomen was sore and my throat was especially sore and dry, but I noticed these things as though someone else was experiencing them.\\n\\nThe nurse helped me change back into my regular clothing and wheelchaired me down to the pickup area. I do not recall being required to pee before leaving, but this period of time is not well remembered. She and my partner helped load me into the passenger seat with some hospital ice packs over my bandage-covered incision sites, a powerade drink awaiting me, and a puke bag shoved into my hand. I was pretty uncoordinated during all this. I don’t recall the ride home much, but I do remember thinking that it was much more pleasant than I expected — maybe because the route we took home was mostly smooth freeway?\\n\\nOnce home, my partner made me steel cut oats with berries and a little bit of brown sugar. Apparently I ate half of this, took an oxycodone + stool softener + laxatives, then passed out in bed. I do not recall any of this.\\n\\n## Recovery\\n\\n**Day 1 highlights**\\n\\n* I ate more than the recommended daily dose of fiber for women my age. (32.5g total) Lots of oats, berries, fruits, pumpkin seeds, a fiber supplement, hemp seed hearts, coffee, spinach, figs, carrots, leaks, farro, and tons of water.\\n* My throat was massively fucking sore. I drank some tea with lemon and honey to try to help. I think the oxycodone helped quite a bit here.\\n* If I went too long without the oxy, I would start to feel sharp pains at the incision sites. So, the opioid was clearly helping with the abdominal pain too.\\n* It was very painful to breath deeply. The documentation from Kaiser made it clear that despite it being painful, it was very important that I practice breathing deeply and coughing (also hard because I couldn’t really use my abdomen muscles). So I did deep breathing exercises and coughed lightly every hour while awake the first couple days.\\n* I did not poop all day and felt very bloated by the end of the day.\\n* By the end of the first day after surgery, I had taken (according to Kaiser's recommendations) 7 laxatives since surgery, 3 stool softeners, had drank 100oz+ of water, had plenty of fiber, had stood up and walked a bit every hour, and had taken 2 oxycodone.\\n* There was periodic vaginal spotting. I wore a couple maxi pads.\\n* I did not experience pain while urinating despite the catheter placed during surgery.\\n* I did not experience shoulder or any other pain attributable to the gas they fill your abdomen with during surgery.\\n* I got to experience exactly how many casual movements engage my abdominal muscles, and how awkward these things become when you can’t use these muscles.\\n\\n**Day 2 highlights**\\n\\n* I woke up at 04:30am to possibly the worst cramps of my life. I was in so much pain, I was reduced to having one desire: escape from the pain. For \\~40 minutes the cramps came and went. I would get up, stumble to the bathroom, pace around the room in misery, sit on the toilet, nothing would come out, the cramps would reduce, I’d stumble back to bed and curl up for \\~2mins until the next wave of cramps came. This was a truly miserable time.\\n* Then from 05:10 - 06:20 I became a literal One Woman Shit Show. A human fecal hosepipe. It started with tiny poops and ended in explosive diarrhea. I shit 6 times over this time frame, drank a little water, then finally passed back out (with cramps reduced) at 06:20.\\n* I woke up again around 10:00 and shit another 5 times over the course of the morning. I was getting a bit worried about dehydrating/losing nutrition, so I drank some water and gatorade and nibbled some peanuts and toast.\\n* I felt so sad and pathetic and overall not good from all that, and was so frightened of going through it again, that I have not touched the oxycodone since then. (Since the opioid has the side effect of constipation)\\n\\nIn fact my discomfort has been manageable and i've continued pooping (but regularly) since The Day 2 Diarrhea Sufferfest, so I haven’t taken anything — opioid, NSAID, laxative, or stool softener. I’ll take an NSAID if I need to, but largely feel ok.\\n\\n**Day 3 and beyond highlights**\\n\\n* sore throat cleared up\\n* breathing became noticeably less painful and now feels normal\\n* light cramps continue, barely noticeable\\n* some abdominal tenderness remains\\n* still some spotting\\n\\n## My Surgeon\\n\\nDr. Gene De Haan? The best. They were thorough and patient in answering all my questions, were entirely receptive to my desire to be sterilized, and overall made me feel respected and safe. They also seem to have done a great job on my surgery as my side effects and pain have been entirely manageable. I poked into their “About Me” section on KP.org and they mention that:\\n\\n&amp;gt;My primary interest is LGBTQ health, with a focus in trans care…I am also committed to partnering with community members to dismantle racism, classism, ableism, homophobia, transphobia, misogyny, fatphobia, and other systems of oppression that exclude people from accessing care.\\n\\nAnd I have even more respect for them knowing how dedicated they are to providing inclusive and accessible healthcare and their interest in serving our historically underserved trans friends. So Dr. De Haan is also a very good noodle, and if you’re in the Portland, Oregon area and need an OB-GYN doc, I recommend them. I am lucky that I was referred to such an excellent surgeon, as I didn't need to do any legwork to find one that would respect my choice to be sterilized.\\n\\n## Closing thoughts\\n\\n* Outside of the day 2 shit-fest, pain has been entirely manageable and I feel like this was an easy surgery to bounce back from -- keeping in mind my age and general good health.\\n* There was a lot of scheduling and preparation to do beforehand as well as things to do / remember, but Kaiser and my healthcare team took on a lot of this burden. I am really grateful for everyone at Kaiser who helped me.\\n* Knowing I would be under general anesthesia eased much of my anxiety.\\n* I am lucky to be a back sleeper, because lying on my sides and stomach have both been uncomfortable on the incision sites.\\n* I got my Mirena renewed rather than removed because Mirena makes my period cramps and bleeding nearly non-existent. I realize BiSalp is basically 100% chance of successful sterilization.\\n* Mirena IUD is so good at preventing pregnancy, that I don’t feel dramatically safer against immediate pregnancy now vs prior to the surgery. However, I do feel a sense of relief that regardless of where reproductive healthcare in the U.S. goes, and regardless of where *I* go in my life, my chance of pregnancy will always and forever be effectively zero.</td>\n",

I was thinking about getting it for myself as a 25th birthday present. \\n\\nHowever, since then, I've been having these doubts. I know that I'm 100% bio kid free and it's not about not having kids. It's more like I'm afraid of losing a natural ability to do *something* regardless of what it is. Like I'm worried about altering this part of myself. I logically know that I will never use it but it still feels like I'm losing something.\\n\\n Sorry for the rambling. I was hoping that someone on here might relate.</td>\n",

       "275  I got sterilized when I was 22 (essure procedure) then later had a bi-salp. It was a decision I made quickly (to have surgery), but I had pretty much always known I never wanted to be a parent, much less pregnant. I can recall having pregnancy nightmares as early as 10 years old (well before I got my first period), and around age 7 my Barbie families never had babies. (I also never wanted a baby doll or anything like that, so it’s not like it was a surprise.)\\n\\nJust because you want to remain child free doesn’t mean you have to undergo surgery. There are always risks, and it’s important to make informed choices. The recovery times vary as well, which is something to consider. There’s also costs associated with the procedures, and insurance doesn’t always cover everything. I’m not saying don’t, because it’s your choice. But if I had known about the side effects of Essure when I had it done (they weren’t well known when I had mine placed), I may have requested a different method. \\n\\nI’m happy to talk more about it with you if you want to get a more in depth perspective. Ultimately whenever it feels right for you is the answer, because that’s different for everyone.   \n",

No issues for me, but my doctor did it under general anesthesia as a precaution. I don’t think they do it anymore though. I personally didn’t have any issues from the procedure. Ended up having a hysterectomy last year for other reasons and they removed my tubes and Essure during that process.   \n",

I have several hobbies that I can work on when I'm not trying to do my actual job. \\n\\nUnfortunately, I was sterilized the next year and the device (Essure ruined my health). It's cost me hundreds of thousands in income because it kept me from working for years. I have a job with a flexible schedule now, but since Essure caused me ADHD to go wild, it's harder to try to make myself work.   \n",

Do your research on it.  Apparently there are cases where the coils migrate and cause damage, and some women have had to have hysterectomies.  For some women, it causes pain.  I may have gotten the procedure done anyways, but I do wish I had done more research on it prior.\\n\\nThat out of the way, being able to have sex with NO fear of getting pregnant has been one of the BEST things for my sex life, because I never have to worry about \"ut ohs\".   \n",

You're 24, your body is pretty much at its peak, it feels difficult to justify changing perfection :)  \\n\\nHowever as you get older you may consider cosmetic procedures.  If you had hair loss, you'd maybe consider something for that.  And you would consider getting your appendix or tonsils out, if they cause problems.  And heaven forbid you get cancer, you would have to cut the bad bits out.\\n\\nAnd that is really what permanent BC is.  You're getting something altered, for a benefit that is relevant to you (i.e. having hopefully lots of great sex with no danger of pregnancy).\\n\\nUltimately, if you're uncomfortable with modifying your body, don't do it.  My point is that as life goes on, you will alter your body for health and personal reasons.  You ARE losing something, but it's about trimming the fat, so to speak.  Losing something that is not useful, for a purpose that is.  Good luck!   \n",

I checked in around 6 am, back for surgery at 7, and done by 11 (I had uterus, tubes, cervix removed, and also a bowel resection as one of my Essure coils had perforated a chunk of bowel). I was able to walk to the bathroom and was discharged around 3 pm. Quick stop for pain meds, then home to bed with my cats.   \n",

but ive known for about a decade now that i never, ever want to be pregnant. part of me wants to do it ASAP, but part of me wonders if i should wait another few years. when i imagine my future, there are no circumstances where i can see myself having kids, so i don't really know why i feel like maybe i should wait. i would love to hear what made y'all confident in your decision to get sterilized.

partner (33M) are both childfree. He had his vasectomy done in early-mid March. But I also wanted to get myself sterilised.\\n\\nWithout going into too much detail, after having a routine surgery go wrong in my teens, I'm terrified of any kind of surgery that involves general anaesthetic/being put to sleep. So I've been looking into female sterilisation that doesn't involve GA, if possible.\\n\\nToday, I just came across something called \"Hysteroscopic Sterilisation\", which I've never heard of before. For anyone who doesn't know, it's when they put micro-inserts into your fallopian tubes, which your body will naturally heal around...? You then get a follow up appointment to see if it's worked, about 3 months after surgery. No GA required, it's normally in outpatients and you can leave the same day.\\n\\nJust wanted to ask the community if any of you have had it done, or know about it, and could tell me more? Or if any of you have had another form of sterilisation that doesn't involve GA that you could recommend, to keep my options open?\\n\\nThanks in advance!\\n\\n**Edit:** Wow, this kinda blew up! Thank you so much to everyone for your advice/experiences, etc. Since it seems this method has either been discontinued, or have a majority of complications/issues, I've decided not to pursue this further. I've decided my partner's snip - and maybe going back to BC - is good enough! Thanks again!  \n",
       "153  Howdy. I’ve read a number of folks’ experiences here in getting sterilized and figured I’d add my own. Overall: very positive, affirming experience! All of the medical personnel who helped me were informative and did not challenge my desire to be sterilized.\\n\\n## Overview\\n\\n**Surgery**: Laparoscopic Bilateral Salpingectomy with a Mirena IUD replacement\\n\\n**Date of surgery**: Friday 14 May 2021 (5 days ago)\\n\\n**Total cost**: my $10 outpatient surgery co-pay, all else is covered by insurance\\n\\n**Surgeon**: [Dr. Gene De Haan](https://healthy.kaiserpermanente.org/oregon-washington/clinicians/gene-dehaan-3541258)\\n\\n**Recommended?** [Abso-lutely](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMnT4tp-cMk&amp;ab_channel=AdultSwim).\\n\\n## Personal Stats\\n\\n**Location**: Portland, Oregon, USA\\n\\n**Age at time of surgery**: 28 years old\\n\\n**Healthcare Provider**: Kaiser Permanente\\n\\n**Pre-existing conditions**? None\\n\\n## Background and Initial Research\\n\\nI particularly appreciated reading [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/truechildfree/comments/m99ceb/got_sterilized_yesterday_19f/)  from this subreddit prior to my surgery for an idea of the experience. In fact, while I didn’t expect it to work, that did inspire me to ask to receive my Fallopian tubes after my surgery to keep as a macabre keepsake. My surgeon was amused, and said they had not received that request before. Unfortunately, this was not feasible as it would require a lot of paperwork because once they’re removed, they’re considered a biohazardous material and can’t just be released to me. They instead offered to provide me with pictures from the laparoscopy as a compromise which I happily accepted :)\\n\\nI also appreciated [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/truechildfree/comments/lzc5hz/my_covidera_sterilization_story_f_32_bilateral/) and have used it as a reference for some helpful content to cover.\\n\\nI didn’t read [this person’s BiSalp experience](https://www.girlvetica.com/home/2017/10/5/my-sterilization-experience-part-1) until after surgery, but it is also a great read.\\n\\nWhen I was initially considering female sterilization (before I had spent much time here) I did some reading before calling up Kaiser to ask about options. Bilateral Salpingectomy was not emphasized online, and most resources I found focused on Tubal Ligation, so that’s what I went in expecting to be recommended. I came in with questions like “does ligation vs implant (Essure) have a higher success rate / fewer complications” and “is Tubal Ligation Pain Syndrome real?” Well, after a discussion with the gynecologist I was referred to, it became clear that Laparoscopic Bilateral Salpingectomy is the gold standard in terms of minimal complications, success rate, and [reducing the risk of Ovarian Cancer](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5865096/). “Fuck yeah, sounds awesome!” I thought, “Cut me up already!” I do recall being annoyed that the hits I received when researching female sterilization focused primarily on tubal ligation, with Planned Parenthood being one of the few resources that even mentioned salpingectomy. I wish I had known about this subreddit sooner.\\n\\n## Cost of Surgery\\n\\nIf you are a member of Kaiser, they have a cost estimator [here](https://www.thconsumeradvantage.com/tcc2/librarian/PFActionId/tcc2.mainpage#!/home). However, because This Is America and healthcare navigation is perpetually in the technological past, they don’t even have estimates for every surgical procedure, including BiSalp. Best estimate I could get was for a hysteroscopic tubal ligation which came out to *$0 out-of-pocket* and *\\~$4,000 covered by insurance*. “Great if true,” I figured. A hand-wavey estimate is better than nothing but not by much.\\n\\n## Paid Medical Leave\\n\\nOnce my surgery was scheduled, I began the process for obtaining paid medical leave via FMLA. (“Family Medical Leave Act” for folks outside the USA) I had to read an introductory letter from my benefits company, call up Kaiser to fill out a “release of information” or ROI, sign and submit a paid leave and benefits agreement, and file for short-term disability benefits. The ROI part was a little dicey because of the relatively short time frame in which the Leave and Disability Management company needed the form, longer turnaround times due to COVID, and my reluctance to receive a medical document via email, notoriously insecure. (The latter concern ended up being addressed.)\\n\\nAfter all the paperwork, I received **2 weeks of paid medical leave**.\\n\\n## Pre-op discussions with my healthcare provider\\n\\nMy first call with Kaiser was on **12 March 2021** (with a Physician’s Assistant) and **by 16 March 2021 I had met with the referred Gynecologist and my surgery was scheduled**. As you can tell from the dates, it was scheduled for \\~2 months out. I recall knowing from the latter visit that I should expect a pre-op appointment, but actually **there were 3 pre-ops** (which initially surprised/confused me): one with my surgeon to cover surgery details, one with a nurse to cover preparation for surgery and reasons after surgery to return to the hospital (e.g. 100.4+ Fahrenheit fever, excessive bleeding, chest pain, vomiting, pain in back of knee indicating blood clot, etc.), and a third one to again discuss preparations for surgery such as what to stop  (no herbal supplements or NSAIDs so goodbye CBDoobs, no drinking, no melatonin, and no Valerian Root 7 days beforehand; also no shaving 2 days beforehand), what drugs to pick up beforehand, when to stop eating (no solid foods 8+ hours before surgery time), and when to stop drinking (nothing but water, coffee without creamer, tea, or apple juice between 8 and 2 hours beforehand, after which point, nothing). I was also instructed to chug 8 ounces of gatorade 2 hours and 15mins before my surgery time to help with recovery after surgery.\\n\\nPrior to these early appointments regarding sterilization, I prepped talking points about why I wanted to be sterilized despite having no children. I planned to steamroll through healthcare providers’ concerns if need be, and go on the offensive if they asked what my partner thought for example, or covered any of the stupid-ass Bingo talking points. Thankfully, and appropriately, none of that was necessary. Every healthcare provider was supportive and entirely receptive to my certainty that I wished to be sterilized. That made me feel safe, supported, and respected :)\\n\\n## Pre-op preparation\\n\\nIn addition to the aforementioned 3 pre-op phone appointments, I had to go in for a **COVID-19 test** between 2 - 5 days before my surgery and **get bloodwork done at least 1 week before my surgery** (actually I got it done 5 days beforehand shhhh). The COVID-19 test was a nasal swab that tickled and made me sneeze. I was prescribed a **scopolamine patch** to affix to bare skin behind an ear 24+ hours prior to surgery to reduce/prevent nausea due to anesthesia. The scopolamine patch is effective for up to 3 days and could be taken off after 24 hours had passed since surgery. I recommend not putting the patch on unnecessarily early, as the side effects I experienced were unpleasant: I gained short-range blurry vision, which prevented me from passing time reading for a while after surgery. I felt disoriented and dizzy the morning of surgery, I felt like I was experiencing the world through a haze, and I felt dissociated from my surroundings. I described my dissociation to my partner in the car on the way to the hospital, and he said that my description reminded him of how he felt on some depression medications he’s taken. Most of these were listed as side-effects of the scopolamine patch in the paperwork that came with the medication, so I wasn’t worried by any of it, but it was overall off-putting.\\n\\nOther drugs/stuff I picked up beforehand, most of them instructed by my doctor: a **stool softener** (Life Line docusate sodium, over-the-counter), a **laxative** (Senna Lax, over-the-counter), an **opioid** (hydrocodone, 6 tablets, prescription), **acetaminophen** (over-the-counter), **ibuprofen** (over-the-counter), **gatorades** (stay hydrated / boost glycogen / yummy sugar), **ice packs** (reduce swelling at incision sites), a **thermometer** (identify fever), **maxi pads** (for managing vaginal bleeding), and I asked my partner to get me some tasty treats so he came home with lemon pound cake and salted caramel chocolate truffles. He’s a good noodle. :)\\n\\nI cleaned all our bedding and vacuumed the night before so I’d have a clean area to convalesce. As instructed by my medical team, I prepared my skin the night before surgery using the 2% chlorohexidine gluconate antiseptic wipes they had mailed me a few weeks prior. I performed a similar wipe down the morning of surgery. This inhibits bacterial growth on the skin, reducing the chance of infection after surgery.\\n\\nI also own a German shepherd dog, and while he normally sleeps with us, he was not invited to do so the first few nights after surgery. Our cats still slept with us, in part because one of them is an asshole who will scream all night and body slam our bedroom door if we lock her out.\\n\\nKaiser also supplies all this “Enhanced Recovery After Surgery” or ERAS info to, as expected, aid recovery following surgery. **TL;DR** walk ASAP after surgery to reduce the chance of blood clots, perform breathing exercises / cough lightly each hour while conscious to prevent pneumonia and atelectasis (you might get an incentive spirometer to help with this), eat regularly to give your body energy to heal, and it’s important to poop ASAP so walk / drink fluids / take laxatives and stool softeners / become a hoover for fibrous foods.\\n\\nI also added some reminders to my Google calendar for things like when to take each of my drugs, when to practice breathing exercises, when to call the hospital if I haven’t pooped yet, and when to remove the scopolamine patch. I knew these would be estimated times at best, but I wanted reminders to at least pop up on my phone for these things so I didn’t have to try to remember them.\\n\\nI definitely recommend front-loading all this preparatory work. That meant while I was healing from surgery, I didn’t have to remember or focus on anything but healing.\\n\\n## Surgery\\n\\nMy surgery was scheduled for 12:30. In the morning I had black coffee and chugged a gatorade at 10:15. I wore a comfy nylon / spandex yoga bra, unisex underwear, sweatpants, and an oversized shirt. I took out all my piercings and brought a book with me, The Wind in the Willows. My partner took the day off work to drive me to/from, and it’s good he did, because it turned out to be an all-day affair. (We didn’t get home until \\~9pm)\\n\\nWe arrived \\~15mins early. We ended up having to wait for close to an hour after arriving as they were running behind. Once they called me back, they had my partner leave because COVID. I was given a medical mask to replace my cloth one. During this time and over the course of the day, I was asked a gazillion times to repeat my name and birth date. They took me to a back room with many people in hospital beds surrounded by curtains that kind of simulated cubicles, all of them against the walls. They asked if I needed to use the toilet then had me change into a hospital gown, some large, soft socks, and a hairnet. They gave me a large, clear, plastic bag to store my stuff. Initially I tied my gown together in the back, but two different nurses mentioned that getting in/out of bed is easier without the gown tied, and one of them untied it for me. I figured, ok, whatever, I’m sure many other bare asses have haunted these halls so I’ll leave mine open too.\\n\\nThey took my vitals, a nurse inserted an IV which stung, and they put sticky heart monitoring pads on parts of my upper body. It’s obvious I don’t like needles inserted, so the nurse kindly put a hot pack on the insertion site and that helped a ton! I barely felt the needle at that point. The nurse had me read over brief paperwork, my main memory of which was seeing confirmation of the procedures (it was actually 3 things: BiSalp, Mirena replacement, and a Pap smear because “might as well”) and me signing my name.\\n\\nLater, the anesthesiologist showed up, gave a brief overview of what would happen, asked if I had ever experienced side effects to anesthesia, and asked if I had questions. My main concern was that I wanted confirmation that I would be knocked out before anything else happened (like intubation or catheter insertion) and they confirmed that yes, I would be knocked out before anything else happened. This meeting was brief.\\n\\nLater on, a different nurse came in to check on me. They also confirmed that I’d been waiting so long, a shift change had occurred.\\n\\nAround 4/4:30p, my surgeon, Dr. De Haan, showed up and apologized for the wait. I was like /shrug, I get it, good health care doesn’t always stick to a schedule. They repeated what procedures I would be undergoing and asked if I’d already filled out the paperwork from earlier. While now I can recall that I did fill out paperwork, at the time I was very confused and drowsy and said that I didn’t think I had. My surgeon offered to check on this and asked if I had any questions. I did not and I think I said that I was ready to be cut open.\\n\\nShortly after this, I was moved to another nearby cubicle which it turns out is the cubicle I ended up recovering in.  I met my new, post-shift-change anesthesiologist. This meeting was brief and basically amounted to “Hi, I’m now the person who will knock you out with a chemical cocktail.” It was nice to meet everyone working on my body, even if briefly.\\n\\nAfter this, it was time, so a nurse came to move me to the operating room. It was kind of fun being casually scooted through the medical halls, and I pretended to be in a slow game of Need For Speed. They pushed me into the surgical room, pressed a lever to elevate me further, and helped me transfer myself to the operating table. There was A LOT of medical shit in this room. Screens flashing, a giant-ass TV hovering in front of me, like 6-7 medical personnel, tables and cupboards, various electronic devices, a giant alien-space-ship-looking light above me. It was a lot to take in. One of the nurses asked if I wanted to know what anything was so I asked questions, but was too overstimulated to remember anything they explained.  The anesthesiologist had hooked me up to something and I could (just barely) feel something being pumped in. I started counting and got up to 10, then decided there was no way it was anesthesia if I was still conscious for that long. I asked the nurse if it was expected that I be feeling dizzy all of a sudden and they confirmed that yes, that was expected. I don’t recall when, but at some point some warm, fabric sleeves were attached to my legs that massaged them to reduce the chance of blood clots.\\n\\nOnce Dr. De Haan arrived, in short order things happened: I think Dr. De Haan mentioned what procedure we were doing, an oxygen mask was put over my face, I breathed in a few times, I looked around a bit, and then: I woke up in the recovery room, groggy, stiff, and reluctant to move.\\n\\nA nurse came over to me. I don’t remember these interactions well, but I do know she called my partner to come get me. I also have these text transcripts between my partner and I at the time:\\n\\n&gt;**me**: Hi  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;**me**: I’m awake  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;**me**: So groggy  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;**partner**: Yay!  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;**partner**: hi  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;**partner**: &lt;sends a creepy greeting sticker&gt;  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;**partner**: I’m expecting a call soon to come get you.  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;**me**: This is so wack  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;**me**: They’re feeding me ice chips\\n\\nMy abdomen was sore and my throat was especially sore and dry, but I noticed these things as though someone else was experiencing them.\\n\\nThe nurse helped me change back into my regular clothing and wheelchaired me down to the pickup area. I do not recall being required to pee before leaving, but this period of time is not well remembered. She and my partner helped load me into the passenger seat with some hospital ice packs over my bandage-covered incision sites, a powerade drink awaiting me, and a puke bag shoved into my hand. I was pretty uncoordinated during all this. I don’t recall the ride home much, but I do remember thinking that it was much more pleasant than I expected — maybe because the route we took home was mostly smooth freeway?\\n\\nOnce home, my partner made me steel cut oats with berries and a little bit of brown sugar. Apparently I ate half of this, took an oxycodone + stool softener + laxatives, then passed out in bed. I do not recall any of this.\\n\\n## Recovery\\n\\n**Day 1 highlights**\\n\\n* I ate more than the recommended daily dose of fiber for women my age. (32.5g total) Lots of oats, berries, fruits, pumpkin seeds, a fiber supplement, hemp seed hearts, coffee, spinach, figs, carrots, leaks, farro, and tons of water.\\n* My throat was massively fucking sore. I drank some tea with lemon and honey to try to help. I think the oxycodone helped quite a bit here.\\n* If I went too long without the oxy, I would start to feel sharp pains at the incision sites. So, the opioid was clearly helping with the abdominal pain too.\\n* It was very painful to breath deeply. The documentation from Kaiser made it clear that despite it being painful, it was very important that I practice breathing deeply and coughing (also hard because I couldn’t really use my abdomen muscles). So I did deep breathing exercises and coughed lightly every hour while awake the first couple days.\\n* I did not poop all day and felt very bloated by the end of the day.\\n* By the end of the first day after surgery, I had taken (according to Kaiser's recommendations) 7 laxatives since surgery, 3 stool softeners, had drank 100oz+ of water, had plenty of fiber, had stood up and walked a bit every hour, and had taken 2 oxycodone.\\n* There was periodic vaginal spotting. I wore a couple maxi pads.\\n* I did not experience pain while urinating despite the catheter placed during surgery.\\n* I did not experience shoulder or any other pain attributable to the gas they fill your abdomen with during surgery.\\n* I got to experience exactly how many casual movements engage my abdominal muscles, and how awkward these things become when you can’t use these muscles.\\n\\n**Day 2 highlights**\\n\\n* I woke up at 04:30am to possibly the worst cramps of my life. I was in so much pain, I was reduced to having one desire: escape from the pain. For \\~40 minutes the cramps came and went. I would get up, stumble to the bathroom, pace around the room in misery, sit on the toilet, nothing would come out, the cramps would reduce, I’d stumble back to bed and curl up for \\~2mins until the next wave of cramps came. This was a truly miserable time.\\n* Then from 05:10 - 06:20 I became a literal One Woman Shit Show. A human fecal hosepipe. It started with tiny poops and ended in explosive diarrhea. I shit 6 times over this time frame, drank a little water, then finally passed back out (with cramps reduced) at 06:20.\\n* I woke up again around 10:00 and shit another 5 times over the course of the morning. I was getting a bit worried about dehydrating/losing nutrition, so I drank some water and gatorade and nibbled some peanuts and toast.\\n* I felt so sad and pathetic and overall not good from all that, and was so frightened of going through it again, that I have not touched the oxycodone since then. (Since the opioid has the side effect of constipation)\\n\\nIn fact my discomfort has been manageable and i've continued pooping (but regularly) since The Day 2 Diarrhea Sufferfest, so I haven’t taken anything — opioid, NSAID, laxative, or stool softener. I’ll take an NSAID if I need to, but largely feel ok.\\n\\n**Day 3 and beyond highlights**\\n\\n* sore throat cleared up\\n* breathing became noticeably less painful and now feels normal\\n* light cramps continue, barely noticeable\\n* some abdominal tenderness remains\\n* still some spotting\\n\\n## My Surgeon\\n\\nDr. Gene De Haan? The best. They were thorough and patient in answering all my questions, were entirely receptive to my desire to be sterilized, and overall made me feel respected and safe. They also seem to have done a great job on my surgery as my side effects and pain have been entirely manageable. I poked into their “About Me” section on KP.org and they mention that:\\n\\n&gt;My primary interest is LGBTQ health, with a focus in trans care…I am also committed to partnering with community members to dismantle racism, classism, ableism, homophobia, transphobia, misogyny, fatphobia, and other systems of oppression that exclude people from accessing care.\\n\\nAnd I have even more respect for them knowing how dedicated they are to providing inclusive and accessible healthcare and their interest in serving our historically underserved trans friends. So Dr. De Haan is also a very good noodle, and if you’re in the Portland, Oregon area and need an OB-GYN doc, I recommend them. I am lucky that I was referred to such an excellent surgeon, as I didn't need to do any legwork to find one that would respect my choice to be sterilized.\\n\\n## Closing thoughts\\n\\n* Outside of the day 2 shit-fest, pain has been entirely manageable and I feel like this was an easy surgery to bounce back from -- keeping in mind my age and general good health.\\n* There was a lot of scheduling and preparation to do beforehand as well as things to do / remember, but Kaiser and my healthcare team took on a lot of this burden. I am really grateful for everyone at Kaiser who helped me.\\n* Knowing I would be under general anesthesia eased much of my anxiety.\\n* I am lucky to be a back sleeper, because lying on my sides and stomach have both been uncomfortable on the incision sites.\\n* I got my Mirena renewed rather than removed because Mirena makes my period cramps and bleeding nearly non-existent. I realize BiSalp is basically 100% chance of successful sterilization.\\n* Mirena IUD is so good at preventing pregnancy, that I don’t feel dramatically safer against immediate pregnancy now vs prior to the surgery. However, I do feel a sense of relief that regardless of where reproductive healthcare in the U.S. goes, and regardless of where *I* go in my life, my chance of pregnancy will always and forever be effectively zero.  \n",

weeks and 3 days post op for da Vincin robotic assisted hysterectomy of uterus and cervix. (tubes removed 2 years ago due to Essure). I kept my ovaries.\\n\\nCervix and uterus was 85.5 grams. Uterus was 10.3x5.5x3.5. Pathology report was negative! No apparent endometriosis was found. \\n\\nEverything went as planned and I already feel better.\\n\\nMy question is this....is this a normal size uterus? From what I have researched, it may be slightly large. I am waiting on my NP to call me and go everything. It took forever for them to get a copy of my surgical report from the hospital for some reason.  \n",
       "146  Howdy. I’ve read a number of folks’ experiences here in getting sterilized and figured I’d add my own. Overall: very positive, affirming experience! All of the medical personnel who helped me were informative and did not challenge my desire to be sterilized.\\n\\n## Overview\\n\\n**Surgery**: Laparoscopic Bilateral Salpingectomy with a Mirena IUD replacement\\n\\n**Date of surgery**: Friday 14 May 2021 (5 days ago)\\n\\n**Total cost**: my $10 outpatient surgery co-pay, all else is covered by insurance\\n\\n**Surgeon**: [Dr. Gene De Haan](https://healthy.kaiserpermanente.org/oregon-washington/clinicians/gene-dehaan-3541258)\\n\\n**Recommended?** [Abso-lutely](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMnT4tp-cMk&amp;ab_channel=AdultSwim).\\n\\n## Personal Stats\\n\\n**Location**: Portland, Oregon, USA\\n\\n**Age at time of surgery**: 28 years old\\n\\n**Healthcare Provider**: Kaiser Permanente\\n\\n**Pre-existing conditions**? None\\n\\n## Background and Initial Research\\n\\nI particularly appreciated reading [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/truechildfree/comments/m99ceb/got_sterilized_yesterday_19f/)  from this subreddit prior to my surgery for an idea of the experience. In fact, while I didn’t expect it to work, that did inspire me to ask to receive my Fallopian tubes after my surgery to keep as a macabre keepsake. My surgeon was amused, and said they had not received that request before. Unfortunately, this was not feasible as it would require a lot of paperwork because once they’re removed, they’re considered a biohazardous material and can’t just be released to me. They instead offered to provide me with pictures from the laparoscopy as a compromise which I happily accepted :)\\n\\nI also appreciated [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/truechildfree/comments/lzc5hz/my_covidera_sterilization_story_f_32_bilateral/) and have used it as a reference for some helpful content to cover.\\n\\nI didn’t read [this person’s BiSalp experience](https://www.girlvetica.com/home/2017/10/5/my-sterilization-experience-part-1) until after surgery, but it is also a great read.\\n\\nWhen I was initially considering female sterilization (before I had spent much time here) I did some reading before calling up Kaiser to ask about options. Bilateral Salpingectomy was not emphasized online, and most resources I found focused on Tubal Ligation, so that’s what I went in expecting to be recommended. I came in with questions like “does ligation vs implant (Essure) have a higher success rate / fewer complications” and “is Tubal Ligation Pain Syndrome real?” Well, after a discussion with the gynecologist I was referred to, it became clear that Laparoscopic Bilateral Salpingectomy is the gold standard in terms of minimal complications, success rate, and [reducing the risk of Ovarian Cancer](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5865096/). “Fuck yeah, sounds awesome!” I thought, “Cut me up already!” I do recall being annoyed that the hits I received when researching female sterilization focused primarily on tubal ligation, with Planned Parenthood being one of the few resources that even mentioned salpingectomy. I wish I had known about this subreddit sooner.\\n\\n## Cost of Surgery\\n\\nIf you are a member of Kaiser, they have a cost estimator [here](https://www.thconsumeradvantage.com/tcc2/librarian/PFActionId/tcc2.mainpage#!/home). However, because This Is America and healthcare navigation is perpetually in the technological past, they don’t even have estimates for every surgical procedure, including BiSalp. Best estimate I could get was for a hysteroscopic tubal ligation which came out to *$0 out-of-pocket* and *\\~$4,000 covered by insurance*. “Great if true,” I figured. A hand-wavey estimate is better than nothing but not by much.\\n\\n## Paid Medical Leave\\n\\nOnce my surgery was scheduled, I began the process for obtaining paid medical leave via FMLA. (“Family Medical Leave Act” for folks outside the USA) I had to read an introductory letter from my benefits company, call up Kaiser to fill out a “release of information” or ROI, sign and submit a paid leave and benefits agreement, and file for short-term disability benefits. The ROI part was a little dicey because of the relatively short time frame in which the Leave and Disability Management company needed the form, longer turnaround times due to COVID, and my reluctance to receive a medical document via email, notoriously insecure. (The latter concern ended up being addressed.)\\n\\nAfter all the paperwork, I received **2 weeks of paid medical leave**.\\n\\n## Pre-op discussions with my healthcare provider\\n\\nMy first call with Kaiser was on **12 March 2021** (with a Physician’s Assistant) and **by 16 March 2021 I had met with the referred Gynecologist and my surgery was scheduled**. As you can tell from the dates, it was scheduled for \\~2 months out. I recall knowing from the latter visit that I should expect a pre-op appointment, but actually **there were 3 pre-ops** (which initially surprised/confused me): one with my surgeon to cover surgery details, one with a nurse to cover preparation for surgery and reasons after surgery to return to the hospital (e.g. 100.4+ Fahrenheit fever, excessive bleeding, chest pain, vomiting, pain in back of knee indicating blood clot, etc.), and a third one to again discuss preparations for surgery such as what to stop  (no herbal supplements or NSAIDs so goodbye CBDoobs, no drinking, no melatonin, and no Valerian Root 7 days beforehand; also no shaving 2 days beforehand), what drugs to pick up beforehand, when to stop eating (no solid foods 8+ hours before surgery time), and when to stop drinking (nothing but water, coffee without creamer, tea, or apple juice between 8 and 2 hours beforehand, after which point, nothing). I was also instructed to chug 8 ounces of gatorade 2 hours and 15mins before my surgery time to help with recovery after surgery.\\n\\nPrior to these early appointments regarding sterilization, I prepped talking points about why I wanted to be sterilized despite having no children. I planned to steamroll through healthcare providers’ concerns if need be, and go on the offensive if they asked what my partner thought for example, or covered any of the stupid-ass Bingo talking points. Thankfully, and appropriately, none of that was necessary. Every healthcare provider was supportive and entirely receptive to my certainty that I wished to be sterilized. That made me feel safe, supported, and respected :)\\n\\n## Pre-op preparation\\n\\nIn addition to the aforementioned 3 pre-op phone appointments, I had to go in for a **COVID-19 test** between 2 - 5 days before my surgery and **get bloodwork done at least 1 week before my surgery** (actually I got it done 5 days beforehand shhhh). The COVID-19 test was a nasal swab that tickled and made me sneeze. I was prescribed a **scopolamine patch** to affix to bare skin behind an ear 24+ hours prior to surgery to reduce/prevent nausea due to anesthesia. The scopolamine patch is effective for up to 3 days and could be taken off after 24 hours had passed since surgery. I recommend not putting the patch on unnecessarily early, as the side effects I experienced were unpleasant: I gained short-range blurry vision, which prevented me from passing time reading for a while after surgery. I felt disoriented and dizzy the morning of surgery, I felt like I was experiencing the world through a haze, and I felt dissociated from my surroundings. I described my dissociation to my partner in the car on the way to the hospital, and he said that my description reminded him of how he felt on some depression medications he’s taken. Most of these were listed as side-effects of the scopolamine patch in the paperwork that came with the medication, so I wasn’t worried by any of it, but it was overall off-putting.\\n\\nOther drugs/stuff I picked up beforehand, most of them instructed by my doctor: a **stool softener** (Life Line docusate sodium, over-the-counter), a **laxative** (Senna Lax, over-the-counter), an **opioid** (hydrocodone, 6 tablets, prescription), **acetaminophen** (over-the-counter), **ibuprofen** (over-the-counter), **gatorades** (stay hydrated / boost glycogen / yummy sugar), **ice packs** (reduce swelling at incision sites), a **thermometer** (identify fever), **maxi pads** (for managing vaginal bleeding), and I asked my partner to get me some tasty treats so he came home with lemon pound cake and salted caramel chocolate truffles. He’s a good noodle. :)\\n\\nI cleaned all our bedding and vacuumed the night before so I’d have a clean area to convalesce. As instructed by my medical team, I prepared my skin the night before surgery using the 2% chlorohexidine gluconate antiseptic wipes they had mailed me a few weeks prior. I performed a similar wipe down the morning of surgery. This inhibits bacterial growth on the skin, reducing the chance of infection after surgery.\\n\\nI also own a German shepherd dog, and while he normally sleeps with us, he was not invited to do so the first few nights after surgery. Our cats still slept with us, in part because one of them is an asshole who will scream all night and body slam our bedroom door if we lock her out.\\n\\nKaiser also supplies all this “Enhanced Recovery After Surgery” or ERAS info to, as expected, aid recovery following surgery. **TL;DR** walk ASAP after surgery to reduce the chance of blood clots, perform breathing exercises / cough lightly each hour while conscious to prevent pneumonia and atelectasis (you might get an incentive spirometer to help with this), eat regularly to give your body energy to heal, and it’s important to poop ASAP so walk / drink fluids / take laxatives and stool softeners / become a hoover for fibrous foods.\\n\\nI also added some reminders to my Google calendar for things like when to take each of my drugs, when to practice breathing exercises, when to call the hospital if I haven’t pooped yet, and when to remove the scopolamine patch. I knew these would be estimated times at best, but I wanted reminders to at least pop up on my phone for these things so I didn’t have to try to remember them.\\n\\nI definitely recommend front-loading all this preparatory work. That meant while I was healing from surgery, I didn’t have to remember or focus on anything but healing.\\n\\n## Surgery\\n\\nMy surgery was scheduled for 12:30. In the morning I had black coffee and chugged a gatorade at 10:15. I wore a comfy nylon / spandex yoga bra, unisex underwear, sweatpants, and an oversized shirt. I took out all my piercings and brought a book with me, The Wind in the Willows. My partner took the day off work to drive me to/from, and it’s good he did, because it turned out to be an all-day affair. (We didn’t get home until \\~9pm)\\n\\nWe arrived \\~15mins early. We ended up having to wait for close to an hour after arriving as they were running behind. Once they called me back, they had my partner leave because COVID. I was given a medical mask to replace my cloth one. During this time and over the course of the day, I was asked a gazillion times to repeat my name and birth date. They took me to a back room with many people in hospital beds surrounded by curtains that kind of simulated cubicles, all of them against the walls. They asked if I needed to use the toilet then had me change into a hospital gown, some large, soft socks, and a hairnet. They gave me a large, clear, plastic bag to store my stuff. Initially I tied my gown together in the back, but two different nurses mentioned that getting in/out of bed is easier without the gown tied, and one of them untied it for me. I figured, ok, whatever, I’m sure many other bare asses have haunted these halls so I’ll leave mine open too.\\n\\nThey took my vitals, a nurse inserted an IV which stung, and they put sticky heart monitoring pads on parts of my upper body. It’s obvious I don’t like needles inserted, so the nurse kindly put a hot pack on the insertion site and that helped a ton! I barely felt the needle at that point. The nurse had me read over brief paperwork, my main memory of which was seeing confirmation of the procedures (it was actually 3 things: BiSalp, Mirena replacement, and a Pap smear because “might as well”) and me signing my name.\\n\\nLater, the anesthesiologist showed up, gave a brief overview of what would happen, asked if I had ever experienced side effects to anesthesia, and asked if I had questions. My main concern was that I wanted confirmation that I would be knocked out before anything else happened (like intubation or catheter insertion) and they confirmed that yes, I would be knocked out before anything else happened. This meeting was brief.\\n\\nLater on, a different nurse came in to check on me. They also confirmed that I’d been waiting so long, a shift change had occurred.\\n\\nAround 4/4:30p, my surgeon, Dr. De Haan, showed up and apologized for the wait. I was like /shrug, I get it, good health care doesn’t always stick to a schedule. They repeated what procedures I would be undergoing and asked if I’d already filled out the paperwork from earlier. While now I can recall that I did fill out paperwork, at the time I was very confused and drowsy and said that I didn’t think I had. My surgeon offered to check on this and asked if I had any questions. I did not and I think I said that I was ready to be cut open.\\n\\nShortly after this, I was moved to another nearby cubicle which it turns out is the cubicle I ended up recovering in.  I met my new, post-shift-change anesthesiologist. This meeting was brief and basically amounted to “Hi, I’m now the person who will knock you out with a chemical cocktail.” It was nice to meet everyone working on my body, even if briefly.\\n\\nAfter this, it was time, so a nurse came to move me to the operating room. It was kind of fun being casually scooted through the medical halls, and I pretended to be in a slow game of Need For Speed. They pushed me into the surgical room, pressed a lever to elevate me further, and helped me transfer myself to the operating table. There was A LOT of medical shit in this room. Screens flashing, a giant-ass TV hovering in front of me, like 6-7 medical personnel, tables and cupboards, various electronic devices, a giant alien-space-ship-looking light above me. It was a lot to take in. One of the nurses asked if I wanted to know what anything was so I asked questions, but was too overstimulated to remember anything they explained.  The anesthesiologist had hooked me up to something and I could (just barely) feel something being pumped in. I started counting and got up to 10, then decided there was no way it was anesthesia if I was still conscious for that long. I asked the nurse if it was expected that I be feeling dizzy all of a sudden and they confirmed that yes, that was expected. I don’t recall when, but at some point some warm, fabric sleeves were attached to my legs that massaged them to reduce the chance of blood clots.\\n\\nOnce Dr. De Haan arrived, in short order things happened: I think Dr. De Haan mentioned what procedure we were doing, an oxygen mask was put over my face, I breathed in a few times, I looked around a bit, and then: I woke up in the recovery room, groggy, stiff, and reluctant to move.\\n\\nA nurse came over to me. I don’t remember these interactions well, but I do know she called my partner to come get me. I also have these text transcripts between my partner and I at the time:\\n\\n&gt;**me**: Hi  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;**me**: I’m awake  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;**me**: So groggy  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;**partner**: Yay!  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;**partner**: hi  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;**partner**: &lt;sends a creepy greeting sticker&gt;  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;**partner**: I’m expecting a call soon to come get you.  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;**me**: This is so wack  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;**me**: They’re feeding me ice chips\\n\\nMy abdomen was sore and my throat was especially sore and dry, but I noticed these things as though someone else was experiencing them.\\n\\nThe nurse helped me change back into my regular clothing and wheelchaired me down to the pickup area. I do not recall being required to pee before leaving, but this period of time is not well remembered. She and my partner helped load me into the passenger seat with some hospital ice packs over my bandage-covered incision sites, a powerade drink awaiting me, and a puke bag shoved into my hand. I was pretty uncoordinated during all this. I don’t recall the ride home much, but I do remember thinking that it was much more pleasant than I expected — maybe because the route we took home was mostly smooth freeway?\\n\\nOnce home, my partner made me steel cut oats with berries and a little bit of brown sugar. Apparently I ate half of this, took an oxycodone + stool softener + laxatives, then passed out in bed. I do not recall any of this.\\n\\n## Recovery\\n\\n**Day 1 highlights**\\n\\n* I ate more than the recommended daily dose of fiber for women my age. (32.5g total) Lots of oats, berries, fruits, pumpkin seeds, a fiber supplement, hemp seed hearts, coffee, spinach, figs, carrots, leaks, farro, and tons of water.\\n* My throat was massively fucking sore. I drank some tea with lemon and honey to try to help. I think the oxycodone helped quite a bit here.\\n* If I went too long without the oxy, I would start to feel sharp pains at the incision sites. So, the opioid was clearly helping with the abdominal pain too.\\n* It was very painful to breath deeply. The documentation from Kaiser made it clear that despite it being painful, it was very important that I practice breathing deeply and coughing (also hard because I couldn’t really use my abdomen muscles). So I did deep breathing exercises and coughed lightly every hour while awake the first couple days.\\n* I did not poop all day and felt very bloated by the end of the day.\\n* By the end of the first day after surgery, I had taken (according to Kaiser's recommendations) 7 laxatives since surgery, 3 stool softeners, had drank 100oz+ of water, had plenty of fiber, had stood up and walked a bit every hour, and had taken 2 oxycodone.\\n* There was periodic vaginal spotting. I wore a couple maxi pads.\\n* I did not experience pain while urinating despite the catheter placed during surgery.\\n* I did not experience shoulder or any other pain attributable to the gas they fill your abdomen with during surgery.\\n* I got to experience exactly how many casual movements engage my abdominal muscles, and how awkward these things become when you can’t use these muscles.\\n\\n**Day 2 highlights**\\n\\n* I woke up at 04:30am to possibly the worst cramps of my life. I was in so much pain, I was reduced to having one desire: escape from the pain. For \\~40 minutes the cramps came and went. I would get up, stumble to the bathroom, pace around the room in misery, sit on the toilet, nothing would come out, the cramps would reduce, I’d stumble back to bed and curl up for \\~2mins until the next wave of cramps came. This was a truly miserable time.\\n* Then from 05:10 - 06:20 I became a literal One Woman Shit Show. A human fecal hosepipe. It started with tiny poops and ended in explosive diarrhea. I shit 6 times over this time frame, drank a little water, then finally passed back out (with cramps reduced) at 06:20.\\n* I woke up again around 10:00 and shit another 5 times over the course of the morning. I was getting a bit worried about dehydrating/losing nutrition, so I drank some water and gatorade and nibbled some peanuts and toast.\\n* I felt so sad and pathetic and overall not good from all that, and was so frightened of going through it again, that I have not touched the oxycodone since then. (Since the opioid has the side effect of constipation)\\n\\nIn fact my discomfort has been manageable and i've continued pooping (but regularly) since The Day 2 Diarrhea Sufferfest, so I haven’t taken anything — opioid, NSAID, laxative, or stool softener. I’ll take an NSAID if I need to, but largely feel ok.\\n\\n**Day 3 and beyond highlights**\\n\\n* sore throat cleared up\\n* breathing became noticeably less painful and now feels normal\\n* light cramps continue, barely noticeable\\n* some abdominal tenderness remains\\n* still some spotting\\n\\n## My Surgeon\\n\\nDr. Gene De Haan? The best. They were thorough and patient in answering all my questions, were entirely receptive to my desire to be sterilized, and overall made me feel respected and safe. They also seem to have done a great job on my surgery as my side effects and pain have been entirely manageable. I poked into their “About Me” section on KP.org and they mention that:\\n\\n&gt;My primary interest is LGBTQ health, with a focus in trans care…I am also committed to partnering with community members to dismantle racism, classism, ableism, homophobia, transphobia, misogyny, fatphobia, and other systems of oppression that exclude people from accessing care.\\n\\nAnd I have even more respect for them knowing how dedicated they are to providing inclusive and accessible healthcare and their interest in serving our historically underserved trans friends. So Dr. De Haan is also a very good noodle, and if you’re in the Portland, Oregon area and need an OB-GYN doc, I recommend them. I am lucky that I was referred to such an excellent surgeon, as I didn't need to do any legwork to find one that would respect my choice to be sterilized.\\n\\n## Closing thoughts\\n\\n* Outside of the day 2 shit-fest, pain has been entirely manageable and I feel like this was an easy surgery to bounce back from -- keeping in mind my age and general good health.\\n* There was a lot of scheduling and preparation to do beforehand as well as things to do / remember, but Kaiser and my healthcare team took on a lot of this burden. I am really grateful for everyone at Kaiser who helped me.\\n* Knowing I would be under general anesthesia eased much of my anxiety.\\n* I am lucky to be a back sleeper, because lying on my sides and stomach have both been uncomfortable on the incision sites.\\n* I got my Mirena renewed rather than removed because Mirena makes my period cramps and bleeding nearly non-existent. I realize BiSalp is basically 100% chance of successful sterilization.\\n* Mirena IUD is so good at preventing pregnancy, that I don’t feel dramatically safer against immediate pregnancy now vs prior to the surgery. However, I do feel a sense of relief that regardless of where reproductive healthcare in the U.S. goes, and regardless of where *I* go in my life, my chance of pregnancy will always and forever be effectively zero.  \n",

just scheduled for my hysterectomy in February.  It’s been a long time coming and I finally found a gyn who understood my pain (literally and figuratively lol).  I have Essure and they have caused so many problems.  I wish I didn’t need to have a hysterectomy but I can’t wait to not feel pain anymore.  Any words of wisdom would be great.  I’m excited and nervous. \\n\\nAlso has anyone had a uterus biopsy?  My dr wants one before surgery to check for cancer. I’m kinda more nervous about that because I won’t be sedated for that.  I did have a biopsy of the cervix once and that wasn’t fun. Lol.  \n",

    Before committing to the CF life with my partner, I was always stressed about how I/we could possibly afford a child (or more) with significant student debt that I still need to pay off while also saving for retirement. \\n\\nBut since deciding to become CF, that stress is gone! I’m getting raise soon and all that money can go towards student debt, more travel, hobbies, and most importantly (and excitingly) a cosmetic surgery. It’s something I’ve always wanted but shied away from because of the cost, and the fact that many women have to have it redone after pregnancy and breast feeding. \\n\\nNot a concern anymore! I can keep my puppies perky and perfect! I’m already confident in how I look, but I’m so excited for my surgery!\\n\\nWhat have you all been able to do since deciding to be CF?  \n",

                                     Hoping this is the right place for this. If it's not just let me know.\\n\\nSo I've known since I was a teen that I wasn't interested in having my own kids. I would possibly be open to the idea of fostering older kids when I'm older but that's still a stretch. \\n\\nAbout two months ago I got really serious about looking into different BC options. I'm pretty set on the Essure procedure and there is a Gyno in my area that will do it once you turn 25. I was thinking about getting it for myself as a 25th birthday present. \\n\\nHowever, since then, I've been having these doubts. I know that I'm 100% bio kid free and it's not about not having kids. It's more like I'm afraid of losing a natural ability to do *something* regardless of what it is. Like I'm worried about altering this part of myself. I logically know that I will never use it but it still feels like I'm losing something.\\n\\n Sorry for the rambling. I was hoping that someone on here might relate.  \n",

                                     Hoping this is the right place for this. If it's not just let me know.\\n\\nSo I've known since I was a teen that I wasn't interested in having my own kids. I would possibly be open to the idea of fostering older kids when I'm older but that's still a stretch. \\n\\nAbout two months ago I got really serious about looking into different BC options. I'm pretty set on the Essure procedure and there is a Gyno in my area that will do it once you turn 25. I was thinking about getting it for myself as a 25th birthday present. \\n\\nHowever, since then, I've been having these doubts. I know that I'm 100% bio kid free and it's not about not having kids. It's more like I'm afraid of losing a natural ability to do *something* regardless of what it is. Like I'm worried about altering this part of myself. I logically know that I will never use it but it still feels like I'm losing something.\\n\\n Sorry for the rambling. I was hoping that someone on here might relate.  \n",

on my pre-op that happened a few days ago. They’ve changed my surgery to a day surgery so I don’t lose my bed again. Our healthcare system is in shambles. I’m wondering if folks wouldn’t mind sharing their experiences of going home the same day/night (if there is an emerg or complications I would stay). I’ve been waiting for this day to come for years but I can’t help but be a little frazzled.  \n",
