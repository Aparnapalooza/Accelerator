Does anyone have any experience with the Essure implant?,"I have an appointment with my nurse practitioner next month and I’m hoping to ask her about sterilization, 

I’m a little hesitant with how invasive tubal litigation is and I’ve done a little bit of research on Essure which has made me lean more towards it. 

However, as with everything, there are a lot of horror stories and I’m just wondering if anyone here had personal experience with it!

Thanks in advance :)",childfree,2018-02-06 05:12:19,appointment nurse practitioner next month hoping ask sterilization little hesitant invasive tubal litigation done little bit research made lean towards however everything lot horror story wondering anyone personal experience thanks advance,anyone experience implant,"Does anyone have any experience with the Essure implant?

Update - Essure confirmation/dye test procedure - AMA,"[Original post] (http://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/2hcvfv/just_had_essure_done_today_ama/)

I had the dye test done today, and I am confirmed blocked - no eggs getting through these tubes! The procedure was similar to getting a pap smear, except there was some cramping and they were up in there longer than they would be for a normal pap. They numbed the cervix, which didn't really hurt, and injected dye, then took photos. They showed me pictures of my uterus and the tubes are indeed blocked! So happy! Anyone wondering about it and wants to know more, ask me anything. 

EDIT - Hoooookay, guys. Apparently I have to do a PSA on my post or hackles will be raised. As everyone should know, do your research before deciding on any medical procedure. I meant this post as a happy one, so I guess if you want to rain on my parade, go ahead, and if you have any questions about my personal experience, ask away. I'm not a doctor, so take what I say simply as the point of view of one regular internet individual.

Finally time to post: Got sterilized Today!,"I didn't want to post this, until the actual procedure was completed, but I finally got a tubal. I'm 30.

After moving to a new city for my career, I wanted to get a gyno exam (hadn't had one in 2 years), as well as inquire about sterilization procedures). I have had Mirena in for almost two years. At the time I had it placed, I did inquire about sterilization then. The doc said he could do it, but it would not help my bad periods (which was my problem). Mirena did alleviate many of my period symptoms, but I have gained 35 lbs since it was placed. This happened while I was on the pill in college (I had a bf then). I had gained 120+ lbs in 6 years! I also had a bad diet and never exercised, but today I eat healthy and exercise regularly. I came to the conclusion that the hormones were making me gain weight.

A small clinic referred me to an OBGYN in a larger affiliate. I went in, prepared to be bingoed. To my surprise, the Dr. and his nurse were very understanding. He did remind me that the procedure was permanent a few times (something he probably has to do), but I was very firm. He offered Essure and a ligation (clip), but I'm allergic to cheap metal, so Essure was not an option. While I was there, the nurse brought up Novasure. It is not birth control, but it drastically reduces, or even eliminated, heavy periods, cramping, and other menstrual issues. I was expecting my bad periods to com back after Mirena was removed for the tubal, so I signed up for that.

The whole process was about four weeks (initial exam
-&gt;ultrasound-&gt;today's procedure). The staff was really supportive, even if it took a few tries to find the vein in my hand for the IV. In the end, Mirena was removed and my tubes were clipped. Unfortunately, the Novasure device would not fit in my uterus, so that did not happen. Talking to my mom afterward, the Dr. told her that Novasure was his favorite ablation method, but there were other options for those with smaller uteruses (uteri?). I did sleep quite a bit today, thanks to the anesthesia, but the pain hasn't been to bad. Think of fairly moderate cramps. As I type this, they are now fairly light and I cannot even feel any pain in my belly button, where the camera was inserted.

I'm just elated that this finally happened, even if Novasure didn't go through. My insurance covered my sterilization completely, though Novasure was my deductable ($450), plus 10% co-insurance ($570). I just wanted to share my experience with others and I did add my doctor to the CF doctor List (Dr. Lieberman, St. Louis, MO).",childfree,2016-05-28 03:53:58,want post actual procedure completed finally got tubal moving new city career wanted gyno exam one year well inquire sterilization procedure mirena almost two year time placed inquire sterilization doc said help bad period problem mirena alleviate many period symptom gained lb since placed happened pill college bf gained lb year also bad diet never exercised today eat healthy exercise regularly came conclusion hormone making gain weight small clinic referred obgyn larger affiliate went prepared bingoed surprise nurse understanding remind procedure permanent time something probably firm offered ligation clip allergic cheap metal option nurse brought novasure birth control drastically reduces even eliminated heavy period cramping menstrual issue expecting bad period com back mirena removed tubal signed whole process four week initial exam gt gt today procedure staff really supportive even took try find vein hand iv end mirena removed tube clipped unfortunately novasure device fit uterus happen talking mom afterward told novasure favorite ablation method option smaller uterus uterus sleep bit today thanks anesthesia pain bad think fairly moderate cramp type fairly light even feel pain belly button camera inserted elated finally happened even novasure insurance covered sterilization completely though novasure deductable plus wanted share experience others add doctor cf doctor list lieberman louis mo,finally time post got sterilized today,"Finally time to post: Got sterilized Today!

"Another Denial for Essure, but Still a Good Experience. Now I need advice!","So I saw another gyno today whom I was told would respect my final decision regarding getting Essure. Unfortunately, she still would not give me Essure, however she was extremely helpful and gave me all the info on Essure I wanted and did not utter a single bingo whatsoever. She said ""I can't see the future; I can't tell you you'll regret it. I just don't feel comfortable performing it on younger women.""

That's fine, she gave me a respectful answer and still answered my questions without demonizing sterilization. She agrees it's a safe and effective procedure, but she prefers IUDs and the implants due to their effectiveness. Although I'm disappointed, I still found her to be an awesome, non-condescending doctor. The first doctor I saw just gave me a long-winded lecture about ""Mr. Right"" and wouldn't answer my questions at all. In the meantime, I think I might go with Nexplanon for three years and try again then.

From you, the community, I ask for any comments on the situation as well as the entire Nexplanon experience.

"Well, shit. Essure Insertion Failed. *TMI Warning!*","Yesterday, I was scheduled for my Essure procedure. I took the Misoprostol four hours before the procedure (at like 5:30am) to soften my cervix. Before I got to the office, I took one Promethazine (for nausea), one 800mg Ibuprofen, and two Norco (hydrocodone). When I got to the office I was in Happy Land and having trouble standing up by myself. The nurse talked to me for a while, and then she gave me a shot of the muscle relaxer, Toradol (the most painful part of the whole process, actually; that thing hurt like a BITCH), and set me up in the procedure room.

The doctor came in and got all set up. Then my cervix wouldn't dilate big enough to get the camera through. Apparently it sits at a really weird angle, too, so that's awesome. She pulled out the camera and gave me a few more shots of lidocaine, which did not hurt, and used a bigger dilator thingie (hooray for medical jargon!) to dilate me more. She got in and found one fallopian tube but had to search around for the other.

Granted, none of this was painful. It just felt weird, like a little bit of pressure and occasionally a poking feeling from inside my lower stomach. But they use saline to expand your uterus so they can see better, and every now and then some of it would leak out and make me feel like I was pissing myself, so that was super awesome.

So she finds both fallopian tubes, and decides to start with the left one. She gets the coil ready, and I watch on the little TV as she inserts it into the fallopian tube and deploys it.

Now, at this point, the Essure coil is supposed to unravel in a nice little line, kind of like a Slinky, you know?

Mine didn't.

Motherfucker got completely snarled. I could literally see a mass of coils wrapped around one another coming out of the end of the tube. Looked like a Slinky then, too, except now it looked like a Slinky that someone had used as a jumprope and then tried to tie into a bow.

And then. AND THEN. SHE HAD TO START PULLING THE *DAMN* THING OUT. 

That fucking *hurt*. It felt like someone was peeling my fallopian tube out through my vagina. What the flying fuck. Seriously.

AND THEN THE DAMN COIL BROKE. INSIDE ME.

AND SHE KEPT HAVING TO GO BACK IN TO GET THE BROKEN PIECES.

Every time she'd pull a little bit of the coil out, I could *feel* it coming out of me. Not nearly as painful as the first time, but still pretty unpleasant, like a tiny little saw blade scraping along my insides. 

So at that point she figured that my left fallopian tube was probably completely seized up, and wouldn't let anything inside of it for a while.

I asked if she might try doing the other tube, but she said she prefers to do both at the same time, or neither. So she tried again after a few minutes, but my left fallopian tube was, as predicted, completely closed up.

When they left the room so I could get dressed, I just sat there and cried for a few minutes. I had been *so* excited to get this done, to get it out of the way, and to do it in a way that allowed me not to miss too much work or deal with excessive recovery time, anesthesia, scars, discomfort, etc.

When I got home, I slept the rest of the day and into the night. 

And then I woke up around 2:00am, weak and still drugged and horribly nauseous and barely able to stand up long enough to get to the bathroom to vomit. I don't know what caused this; they gave me the Promethazine for nausea, and I've never had any problems with Norco (hydrocodone) - I took that and Percocet when I had my wisdom teeth removed and got dry sockets. 

But the nausea and vomiting kept me up most of the night and morning, so I have to miss another day of work to recover. And I've been bleeding on and off all night (dark brownish blood, so I highly doubt I'm hemorrhaging, it's just really annoying).

My doctor is supposed to call me today to talk to me about my options, which are mostly likely going to be either Tubal Ligation or an IUD. I don't think she's going to want to try the Essure a second time, but maybe she will. If she wants to try again, I'm totally up for it, because I don't want to have to deal with the hospital for a tubal. I don't like hospitals. And the pain really wasn't bad enough to make me unwilling to try again.

So, yeah. That really fucking sucked. Overall it wasn't too painful, just very, very disappointing. :(

Essure Done. No more mixed bag.,"I started feeling excited when we neared the hospital. And then really scared the IV was going to be painful (only had it done once before and it was on my hand and hurt like a *bitch*). And then scared that the pain during the surgery was going to be bad.


The only uncomfortable part was her sticking fingers in me to put some kind of gel inside. I was sleepy from not sleeping well the night before (was stressed I was going to be late, don't sleep well when I stress, very counter productive). So as soon as they sedated me, I started falling asleep.



I remember them telling me to breathe twice, I was falling asleep so much my breathing was slow and shallow (as one's breathing usually is when they're asleep), so they put me on oxygen. I woke up a couple time to ask if I could lift it to scratch under it. Which they allowed.



They let my best friend stay in the operating room, and I couldn't be more grateful for that.


I woke up again near the end, and saw the coil in the last tube and they said. ""All done!""


And I said ""Already?""


""Yep!""


I lied down for awhile, they got us juice and crackers. And as soon as I started getting dressed, I was nauseous, they gave me some anti nausea medicine and had me lie back down. Felt well enough to leave, but heavy cramping (which was par the course).



Went to Walmart, got a heating pad, and Ibuprofen, and my friend dropped me off at home. I just woke up from a nap with the heating pad on me, and it's just a leftover abdomen soreness, and the cramping and nausea has dissipated, and I have an appetite again. Going to go eat here shortly.



I was very out of it after the surgery, and as was my friend because she was tired and just getting over a cold herself. So it was like two zombies talking in the car. And I felt happy I got it, but very focused on the pain I was in.



But, now I'm elated. Something I've wanted for years is complete. Something I didn't even know was feasible for me until I came to you guys (I had heard all the scary stories about sterilization and didn't know that a lot of it was just hype).



It's so nice that in three months, when my tubes close over, that I will be able to stop worrying about a pregnancy (outside of ectopic, and I will still take pregnancy tests regularly to ensure those are not the case). And I have the extra back up of my patch that I'm going to keep using, and really hope the government doesn't take it away from me, because I love my regulated period on it. But, even if they do, I have my Essure, and I will always be forever grateful for that. 



Thank you to all of you here, you have all been so formative and helpful for me. Helping me take steps I never though I'd take. /u/thr0wfaraway has been an inspiration in my life other than my Childfree stance. Their motto ""Don't be a doormat"" has been something that has stuck with me ever since I read it. And that phrase is something that's gotten me through some really tough times.

No more mixed bag. I started feeling excited when we neared the hospital. And then really scared the IV was going to be painful (only had it done once before and it was on my hand and hurt like a *bitch*). And then scared that the pain during the surgery was going to be bad.


The only uncomfortable part was her sticking fingers in me to put some kind of gel inside. I was sleepy from not sleeping well the night before (was stressed I was going to be late, don't sleep well when I stress, very counter productive). So as soon as they sedated me, I started falling asleep.



I remember them telling me to breathe twice, I was falling asleep so much my breathing was slow and shallow (as one's breathing usually is when they're asleep), so they put me on oxygen. I woke up a couple time to ask if I could lift it to scratch under it. Which they allowed.



They let my best friend stay in the operating room, and I couldn't be more grateful for that.


I woke up again near the end, and saw the coil in the last tube and they said. ""All done!""


And I said ""Already?""


""Yep!""

"Essure isn't a thing anymore, right?","Hello all!

So I am finally taking the steps to get myself sterilized. I have Southern California Kaiser Permanente. With them sterilization is a self-referral kind of situation. Before I am allowed to make an appointment with the doctor I need to take a 2-hour class with other women about my ""options"" as they put it. They said I would be getting a pamphlet in the mail before my class (which is this coming Tuesday). 

So, a couple days ago I got this pamphlet. It was super weird because it came in a large yellow envelope that was hand-addressed and had no return sender on it. All that was inside was this pamphlet. This pamphlet as it turns out, was written by Bayer, and over half of it was just promoting the use of Essure for sterilization. Then toward the back they talked about tubals and then temporary birth control.

This SUPER threw me off. I remembered hearing all kinds of awful stuff about Essure, lawsuits, the FDA black-box warning, and I found an article saying that they had stopped selling them in the US in July of last year. So what the heck is with this pamphlet?! Kaiser is normally very good at giving good information in my experience. Was something about Essure changed? I for sure don't want it, and unless there was some kind of change I am unaware of I really feel like they shouldn't be sending out literature about such an unsafe method? 

I am debating if I should make a stink about this with Kaiser when I go in Tuesday, or call Member Services, or maybe I should contact someone else? I really hope they aren't actually still putting these in people!

CF thoughts on plastic surgery,"So I've been considering getting a boob job for a couple years. The thing that kept holding me up wasn't the money, it was me being freaked out by the idea of any surgery. The only medical procedures I've ever had were my Essure/ablation last year and my wisdom teeth removal in high school. But I really wanted to do this.

The thing that helped me get over it was my utter fear and disgust at the idea of childbirth. As I was looking through the millions of photos on RealSelf and seeing tons and tons of posts that start with, ""had two kids, ruined my boobs,"" ""breastfeeding left my breasts sad and deflated,"" etc etc I realized that people go through childbirth all the time and act like it's nothing and I find that utterly horrific. I mean, you get stretch marks, vomiting, and at the end you either get to shove something the size of a watermelon out of a hole the size of a lemon or you get your abdomen sliced open. But no one asks you with fake concern beforehand if ""you're sure if you want to put yourself through all that.""

Plus at the end of it all, you get a squalling creature that shits on your dreams instead of a magnificent rack.

So thanks CF-ness for reminding me that even if the boob job is going to hurt and I'll be uncomfortable for a few weeks, I can survive.",childfree,2016-05-30 20:02:22,considering boob job couple year thing kept holding money freaked idea surgery medical procedure ever last year wisdom teeth removal high school really wanted thing helped utter fear disgust idea childbirth looking million photo realself seeing ton ton post start two kid ruined boob breastfeeding left breast sad deflated etc etc realized people childbirth time act like nothing find utterly horrific mean stretch mark vomiting end either shove something size watermelon hole size lemon abdomen sliced open one asks fake concern beforehand sure want put plus end squalling creature shit dream instead magnificent rack thanks reminding even boob job going hurt uncomfortable week survive,cf thought plastic surgery,"CF thoughts on plastic surgery So I've been considering getting a boob job for a couple years.

My bisalp and ablation experience,"I’ve been debating on positing about this here. I don’t want this to be seen as an attempt to stop someone from choosing sterilization. Shit, by the time I get this fixed I will be sterilized for the third time. I just want to hopefully save one person from what is happening to me. 

In 2016 I had Essure placed, but the coils started to bother me so in 2019 I had a bisalp and ablation. My recovery was nothing. It was a grand ol’ time. The first two years were amazing. Until September of last year. 

I began feeling like I was having cramps, but I couldn’t tell if it was uterine cramps or if I was constipated, honestly. I went to my gyn who scheduled me an ultrasound to make sure everything is okay. 

They found that I was beginning to bleed behind my scar tissue, and the blood was trapped. Each month things got worse. My uterus contracts continually to try to get it out, but there is no where for it to go as my tubes and cervix are closed off. My gyn says it is worse than labor. It lasts for two weeks every two weeks until my body reabsorbs the blood. 

This month the pain is at an all time high. I take toradol, percocet, and dilaudid, none of which work. I’ve been to the ER twice in the last week where they tell me there is nothing stronger they can give me. The end is in sight for me. I have a hysterectomy scheduled for the 1st, after battling insurance for months for it. I just have to somehow make it through the next nine days. I just writhe in bed, scream, cry, and vomit from pain until then. 

What I have is rare, but please don’t take the chance of it happening to you. Just do the tubal, or opt for a hyst. Please don’t do what I did.

Wondering about hormonal IUD side effects vs copper?,"I know, I know, there's a lot of info already out there about side effects, but I'm worried about a couple of things and I was looking to hear some more personal experiences with them.

I'm worried about the cramping with a copper IUD. I already get pretty nasty cramps during my period, so this isn't something I want to get worse. However, the long term option is really important to me, especially since I really don't want children at all.

I would also be alright with going on Mirena or Skyla or something similar, but I've had bad hormonal side effects to taking the pill, and considering I'm already bigger in the breast area/struggling with my weight in general, I don't really want to risk gaining weight, especially in my boobs. (I'm a 34 F/G).

Considering everything that's been going on this week regarding the US deciding that employers can opt-out of birth control coverage, I've just decided to take it upon myself and finally get a form of long acting contraception. I'm not against the implant either, but it seems like the IUD is the most effective way to go. Also, I would absolutely get Essure, but I'm only 25 and I still feel like my doctor will not take me seriously.

Great experience at the doctor's office today,"I had my consultation appointment this morning to see a gynecologist about having a tubal. Given things that I had read here and in other places, I wasn't sure what to expect going in. To my relief, the doctor was awesome. She presented the options of IUD, Essure, and tubal, I asked a few questions and confirmed that the tubal was what I wanted, and she gave me the consent paperwork to sign. 

I asked if my husband needed to sign anything and she was surprised that I had asked. I explained that in my research it seemed that it was sometimes difficult to find a doctor willing to do a sterilization on a woman without children, and she said ""Really? This is 2013! If you know you don't want children it's better to have a sterilization than to have kids."" (And then the angels started singing...) The only time 'changing your mind' even came up was when she mentioned that a lot of doctors won't even do tubal reversals anymore, because IVF is so successful and less invasive.

"I am sure about Essure!
","Hello fellow CFers!

Two days ago, at 730 am I had my Essure procedure done. My mom arrived at my house at 5 am to drive me to the dr, since I've never had children, and have a smaller cervix, and vaginal opening, I had to be put under anesthesia during the procedure, and I needed someone to drive me home.

I got the the surgery ward at 6 am (as requested) went over all my paper work, then my mom and I were taken into my pre-op room where I had to sign a couple more things, and get my IV. My mom and I got to meet all the doctors that would be in the room with me, and my mom was able to have any questions she still had answered. The last thing I remember is them putting more blankets on me in the operating room, and the next thing I know I'm waking up in recovery, asking a nurse where to get discounted scrubs (my mom is also a nurse, and needed some new ones).

After I woke up, walked around a little bit, and went to the bathroom, they let me leave.  My mom took me to lunch, and we did a little shopping, then she took me home so I could nap. I had very mild cramping on Thursday, was back at work on Friday, and this morning. I do have vicodin for my pain, but I have only needed to take two or three, and thats just because when I was at work it started to get a little more crampy then if I was just sitting/laying down (I work in a fast paced retail environment.)

Anyway, I had a great experience. I go back in a few months to make sure it is 100%, and I will never have to worry about birth control again!!

I will answer any questions anyone has, but I may not get around to it until tomorrow, my fiance's band has a show in an hour.

Preparing to be bingoed at my pre-procedural consult!!!,"So I am not CF, I am one &amp; done. I had my daughter young, she'll be out of the house in my late-30s. She's a great kid, very smart, well-behaved, and everything I could ask for in a child. I'm not with her father but we co-parent amicably and are good friends. I have career goals which involve pursuing a PhD and it seems unethical to have any more kids if their childhoods might play second-banana to my career. All the reasons I could think of for wanting more biological kids are selfish, particularly living in a state where many children are in the system due to the ongoing opioid epidemic.

So it's time for me to get spayed. I saw our local women's health NP and we talked and she thinks it's a fine idea and had me sign off for consent to be referred to the surgeon who performs the tubal ligation. However, I was warned that the surgeon would probably want to have a ""long conversation"" with me about my ""options"", considering my age (I am turning 27 soon). On top of being bingoed, I'm also a little worried he'll pressure me to try a new medical device and, after the Essure tragedy, I'm interested in an old-school cauterization or cut procedure.

I plan to write a long list of reasons why I would like to be sterile, believe it unethical to have more blood kids, don't want *any* kids *period* (I would adopt if it meant giving a kid a good life, or helping a family member stay in the family), etc. However, I'd also like to write some rebuttals to common bingos, as I'm preparing to be bingoed by the surgeon.

Consultation appointment made! Advice?,"I’m new here, so bare with me. 

As a 24 year old, it seems “impossible” to find doctors that are going to take my decision to not have children seriously. I have ALWAYS had to defend myself (as many on this sub do) in regards to my choice. 

I have an appointment next week for Essure consultation. I’ve been doing my research about it for an extensive amount of time and I feel it’s the most realistic option for me. 

I’ve been on birth control for ten years. Most of the time, I’ve been on the pill. I’ve also tried Depo Provera and the Paragard IUD. The IUD gave me hell, despite it being hormone free... so sad. 

Can anyone share their Essure experience or give me pointers for this consultation? Am I getting too excited for my own good?

Just learned about horrible Essure reactions,"I've (obviously) been looking into permanent sterilization methods--specifically, tubal ligation for many, MANY years now, but I know that at 28, F, no kids it's impossible--I even asked a gyno relative who literally said ""yeah no one would do it for you.""

So then I learned about Essure from the internet and it sounded awesome, and that I could actually get it done most likely. The description was something like ""this is a metal implant, surrounded with [metal] with a nickel interior"" which kind of made me nervous, but at the time (and currently) I'm with an SO who wants babies (long story) so I couldn't get it in any case. Today I just read someone on here talking about how Essure was successful for them so I remembered about the Nickel thing for some reason, and randomly googled it, and apparently a TON of women have horrible reactions to it. I really don't know if it's okay to post links (probably not?) because I only ever browsed reddit (and I'm pretty sure my only post is to the xbox forum) but I found so many stories of people who get so sick from this thing. And also apparently initially doctors had to ask ""do you have metal allergies"" but the company that makes it sued the FDA so that they didn't have to ask that, I guess to implant it more. Shady town.

I dunno, I just wanted to vent about this I guess, it really freaked me out and I'm honestly glad I couldn't get it when I read about it. I love jewelery and have an f ton of piercings but they are all pure titanium because when I put anything else in, my ears swell and I get wonderful smelly pus and pain and crust and ugh. Rings also stain my skin green... I tolerate it because I'm only wearing it in my ears for like 12 hours max and the jewelery is pretty... I just can't imagine that inside of me.

Today was my Essure day...,"I'm 30, married (open marriage though) and started the process about a month and a half ago to get the Essure procedure since my insurance covers it 100%. Went on birth control for a month to get everything ready and today was the day of the procedure. 

They do it with anesthesia which is awesome so I don't have to feel anything. I had an IUD insertion done once with absolutely no numbing or anesthesia and holy fuck that was the most painful thing I've ever done in my life.

My OB/GYN could only get an Essure coil into one of my fallopian tubes so I have to go back in to get the other one done next week. He's gonna try to put another coil in but if it won't go he's just going to do a tubal ligation on that side. Of course I *had* to be special and have one tube not cooperate. 

He's the coolest OB/GYN I've ever met though. Totally respected my decision to get sterilization and had no issues performing it on me. Was also totally cool with the fact that I'm not monogamous and wanting it done too.

Sterilization Questions,"Hey there. 

Using a throwaway because I've got identifying details in my main account. 
I feel a bit odd writing here, as I'm not the traditional personal for childfree, but I would really love the advice that I believe this community can offer.
I had a child at a relatively young age, and while I adore her and the decision to have her, I understood, almost immediately that I was absolutely done having children. 
Given my age, even with having had a child, undergoing sterilization has been an uphill battle. 
I have an appointment scheduled at Planned Parenthood to discuss options, and hopefully remove my IUD for a more permanent solution, but I was hoping to hear from individuals who have undergone something like Essure, or a laparoscopic tubal ligation as those are the two methods I am currently leaning towards.

Too old to bother with a tubal?,"I know we talk these topics into the ground but I think I have a slightly different spin.

I'm 33 years old. I currently have an IUD which I'll continue on until menopause.

But by god if I had known sooner in my life how certain I was and ACA had come along sooner I would be in the stirrups demanding a snipsnip!

More sterilization questions: hysterectomy edition,"Like many people on this subreddit concerned with this topic, I'm young, unmarried, and have never had children, and obviously I like it that way. Unlike most people, when I get cramps, they knock me out for days. I'm talking pain from my upper back to my knees that is so intense the effort of standing up blinds me. Hormonal birth control has really taken care of that, but there is a history of strokes in my family, and once I'm on my own for insurance it won't be so cheap, so I'm looking for a better solution.

For these reasons, it seems like just the Essure procedure wouldn't really deal with the pain, which prescription grade Naproxen horsepills couldn't touch. In addition, I easily slip into anemia when I don't make a conscious effort to eat iron rich foods. It seems to me that this is a good argument for a hysterectomy:

1. No cramps from hell, because nothing is there to cramp

2. I get to keep all my nutrient stores, not bleed them out

3. No periods! No hormones! No effort!

Obviously, this is going to be the most uphill of battles. Anyone have any advice for convincing a doctor that I'm not just going for Essure, I'm going hysterectomy or bust?

Hormonal birth control has really taken care of that, but there is a history of strokes in my family, and once I'm on my own for insurance it won't be so cheap, so I'm looking for a better solution.

For these reasons, it seems like just the Essure procedure wouldn't really deal with the pain, which prescription grade Naproxen horsepills couldn't touch. In addition, I easily slip into anemia when I don't make a conscious effort to eat iron rich foods. It seems to me that this is a good argument for a hysterectomy:

1. No cramps from hell, because nothing is there to cramp

2. I get to keep all my nutrient stores, not bleed them out

3. No periods! No hormones! No effort!

Obviously, this is going to be the most uphill of battles. Anyone have any advice for convincing a doctor that I'm not just going for Essure, I'm going hysterectomy or bust?

"Scheduled my Tubal today! (It's what I want, but WHY am I nervous?)","I wish I had a valiant story of fighting the good fight, but I had it really easy. I'm very lucky to be in upstate NY.  
My hair has been thinning pretty badly recently, &amp; I blamed my nexplanon. I called planned parenthood about getting it taken out and *finally* getting something permanent. They directed me to a proper OB-GYN for such a procedure.  
I found one in my town that took my insurance and set up an appt. I told the very funny, very rambly, doc about my hair &amp; she said because it's been a few years, it was unlikely hair loss due to hormonal birth control. (Well, shit. 😰)  So I said, ""Look. I love nexplanon. The whole set it &amp; forget it thing is great, but I know I don't want kids. I'm 35, I should probably stop messing around and just get something permanent, right?""  
""Right, "" she says. ""When do you want to schedule your tubal?""  

We talked details, why Essure isn't the best option, and a few risks &amp; things about surgery. It was that easy.  

Even with all that, I'm still nervous. Not about the procedure itself, but with the permanence of it. It's definitely what I want, I have no desire whatsoever to become a mother.

I know it seems wishy-washy, but I try to always have a backup plan for major life decisions &amp; there's not that option with this. I don't know why my head and heart both agree about never having kids, but still want to disagree on getting a Tubal Ligation.

I've been strongly adamant in the last couple of years that I do not want kids.

* Is the procedure covered by insurance? If not, what was the out-of-pocket cost?

* I've heard tubal ligation as opposed to essure is more effective in the long-run, as you're more likely to get pregnant from essure after a few years. What has your experience been like with either one of these procedures?

Experiences with long-term/permanent birth control and PCOS?,"I am going to go into my provider next month and asking their opinion, but I'd like to know some other women's experiences of going to either a long-term or permanent method of birth control who specifically have PCOS.

Any experience with Essure?,"So yesterday, I went into PP for a check-up, was met with a lot of reassurance and helpful advice, and upon bringing up sterilization, the clinician did not bat an eye at questions on the topic (YAY).  Her recommendation was the Essure method of tubal ligation, which is something I have briefly looked into, and it seems fairly controversial.

In theory, it seems like a pretty great idea. Minimally invasive, out-patient procedure, quick healing, almost completely effective. However, I have read that there are some fairly substantial risks around complications. 

I'm wondering if any female-bodied CF folks have had the procedure, what your experiences are, if you have experienced any complications, adverse-effects, or none at all.

Tubal Ligation &amp; Insurance,"I have been reading a lot of posts in /r/childfree lately, in anticipation of my tubal ligation the end of July (yay!).

I have noticed quite a few people have said their TL was covered by insurance, and I was hoping I could get some advice on what questions to ask and how to find out if this is an option for me. 

Currently I am being told that because it is an outpatient hospital procedure, there will be a $500 co-pay (I do not have a deductible, so that is a plus). I live in the US and I pay for my own insurance (job does not offer any and I live in MA, so I have to buy it myself). 

I did already speak with my insurance company and they said it would need to be billed as ""family planning"" if I wanted to get the $25 co-pay. I then spoke with the surgical scheduling RN about this and she said that no, because it was in the hospital and I would be given anesthesia, they had to bill it as outpatient hospital. She offered to discuss switching to Essure, which is an in office procedure, but I do not want to go that route. 

Paying $500 is not a deal breaker, and I am prepared to pay it, but wanted to see if anyone had any other suggestions as to how I can try to get my co-pay reduced. 

Thanks!

edit: update. I called the hospital to discuss billing codes, and the woman on the phone accused me of trying to manipulate the bill to avoid paying what I owe! She was so out of line I asked to be transferred to someone else (who was a little bit helpful). Next step will be talking with my surgeon's office on Monday.

My Essure may not have worked /rant,"Hi guys,

The whole sterilization thing has been a saga from the get go; 28 Sept I had the first essure put in place [super gyno couldn't find the other fallopian tube], had super expensive ultrasound and voila the other fallopian tube is hiding in my 2nd uterus [who'da thunk it]

The second Essure proceedure was hugely painful and difficult- one essure broke while my hidden fallopian tube was dancing the fandango so Super Gyno had to run out and get another. Fun times.

Now I've just had the 'final' test which is inconclusive and I have to go through another more painful test to see if I'm 'good to go'. The gyno warned me it's a tad more 'uncomfortable' than the essure placement. After this test I could need another friggin proceedure to finally achieve infertility.

Figured I'd post something a bit happier today.,"Due to the shifting healthcare laws in the US right now, I got automatically enrolled in my state's new healthcare program. Good news? The doctor they assigned me is actually in my own city!

We both want to be 'Out Of Order' | Questions,"So my husband and I are proud DINKS have no intention nor desire to reproduce. So we are definitely in the mind set of 'let's make this permanent!' I believe that we should both go through the process together as so neither of us feel like one made the 'ultimate sacrifice' etc. (not that this is an issue) He is 100% ready to go regardless if I get approved which is great I just know as a female my chances of finding a dr to take my 'womanhood' are very slim. And also why not be Double Sure.

(I know there are some topics already on here pertaining to people's experiences)

So my question is for all the men and women who have gone through their sterilization process is the following:

Men:

- What trials did you have to go through (ex many different drs, therapy etc) when reaching out to get the process going?

- Did you take a fertility test prior to the surgery?

- Any risks or complications, during and after the surgery?

- When you went in for the follow up, were your results positive in the sense that you are not producing sperm?

- I have heard of problems like low testosterone and low sex drive, did you encounter this at any point? 

- Any other information you'd like to share?

Women:

- Did you go through a fertility test prior to asking drs?

- How many drs did you contact before finding the one who agreed?

- Was there anything you said during the consultation that made the doctor immediately say No?

- If you have a SO did they do with you to the preliminary consultation, if so did this help the DR realize you were serious with your partner or did it not phase the dr?

- Any risks or complications during or after the procedure?

- Which method did you choose (tubal, essure, hysterectomy etc)?

- Long term (if any out there), how do you feel now year(s) after the surgery, your cycle, hormones, body etc?

- Sex drive, did the procedure kill it?

- Any other information you feel is vital to know going into this?


Thanks in advance. Personally as a female I have read oh so many pamphlets and side effects etc on all the options. Every single one is always referencing women who had kids prior, which makes me wonder if some of the more serious side effects and serious problems that can occur are because a woman already had conceived at one point? The idea of drs and all that already makes me light headed, but it is something I want to do and go through just for the certainty and peace of mind.

Question for sterilized ladies,"Hello you beautiful bunch!

I've been researching some permanent birth control solutions. I've been taking the pill religiously for 10 years now (25F), and it's been great so far, but I'm thinking ahead :)

So my question is: after, say, a salpingectomy, is it possible/not too risky to keep using a contraceptive pill, as it keeps my (otherwise chaotic) hormonal balance in check?

I know that the pill stops me from ovulating, but there is that teeny tiny failure rate that scares me into thinking seriously about getting snipped. 

Sorry if this doesn't belong in this sub, but I figured I might ask first-hand witnesses, and besides google didn't return anything relevant, no matter how I twisted the keywords around :/ (no, I'm not interested in getting pregnant after essure, bad google! :p)

My ACA Open Market Insurance plan doesn't cover Essure. I'm sad but probably going to go with Mirena.,"As a self-employed person I was without insurance until I signed up for an ACA plan. I hate my plan. My copay for my Psychiatrist is $75 and it doesn't cover my OCD meds. They don't pay for my therapist either.

I've been researching Essure and really wanted to do it. Today when I called with the procedure code they said it counts as a surgery and my deductible applies. My deductible is $5600.  An IUD is only a $10 copay so I started researching those.

I'm very disappointed in this plan that I pay $249 a month for. But at least I have insurance. When I left my job before ACA I couldn't get insurance because OCD was a pre-existing condition. 

Sorry, I just wanted to complain a little. 

EDIT: Thank you for the information. I read it all and then recalled my insurance a few moments ago. Using the three procedure codes on the Essure brochure I found out that the original code for the procedure is covered 100%.  That is not what the guy said yesterday.  However, the two codes  for the confirmation test are not covered and count toward my $5600 deductible.

Intro and child free-friendly doctor for the list!,"I've had a hellish few years following a traumatic brain injury and subsequent surgery. This only reinforced my commitment to remain CF - with permanent nerve damage, confusion, and sight and hearing loss, there is NO WAY I would ever be able to take care of a child.

I'm 28 now and knew I didn't want kids by the time I was six or seven. I have a clear memory of sitting on my mother's bed, sobbing hysterically, because I didn't think I could get married if I didn't have kids. Luckily, my parents are both wonderful and understanding.

My husband and I moved from NoVa to NC last year, so I figured that since I was relatively healthy for the first time in four years and I was still in recovery from brain surgery and so I'd barely even notice any pain, I would start the quest for sterilisation. I made an appointment with an ob-gyn at the recommendation of a friend (with two small girls). They saw me within a week. I told the doctor I was getting near the end of the expectancy of my Paragard and wanted to explore my options. When I said I wanted to be sterilised, she said 'well, I don't do Essure but if you're sure, I have no problem tying your tubes. We will call your insurance company to double-check your coverage and then we will phone you to set up the surgery at the women's hospital!'

Am I being unreasonable by withholding sex until he gets a vasectomy?,"My partner and I am having a huge disagreement.  I have a history of blood clots, so I am no longer allowed to take hormonal birth control pills, the essure coils failed on me, and I have a history of endometriosis and severe scarring in my abdominal cavity and my doctor will not perform a tubal ligation due to the increased risks of bowel perforation because of the scarring.  I have been the one responsible for birth control for our entire 18 year relationship. We do not want anymore children. When I was allowed to take hormonal birth control, I had a severe reaction to Depo provera, and it took awhile to find a pill that worked for me.  I am also allergic to latex.

I'm taking my story to the press.,"I just needed to rant and/or seek some support. I'm in the US for reference. Also warning for language.

I can not find a single doctor that will do a tubal or Essure on me. 26, no kids. First it was ""be 18"" then 21, then 25, now 35 or 40!! My mom hit menopause at 45, man! 

It took me years just to get an IUD! Because I might accidentally become sterile from doctor error and, of course, being sterile will ruin my life and my cervix is too small and my uterus might rupture. Or ""you have to be in a stable marriage and your husband okay with it, because promiscuity could lead to sterility.""
Do fucking OBGYNs even fucking study the shit they're supposed to know?!
But I get ovarian cysts from the IUD. I've tried 25+/- birth control pills. I can't get the copper IUD because I already have heavy/painful periods. I. Want. My. Damn. Sterilization.

ARGH! I'm just so angry! I'm done! Sick of it!

""You husband could have a vasectomy.""

Yes. Well, you know what? I enjoy sex too, and he isn't comfortable with a needle in his nuts. I AM. 

Anyway. It's going to press soon, and I'm nervous as much as I am excited. I don't want to give out too much detail.

"Had ""the"" convo with my parents - things went better than expected.","Sorry for the wall of text but it feels good to vent.
___

If you can't see my flair, I'm 25 F and married.  I set up an appointment for Essure in July, and just had the conversation with my parents about this decision, and things went a lot nicer than I had imagined.

No bingo's, that was nice.  My mother had a little advance warning because I had made some offhand comments to her about not having kids.  My father apparently had no idea.  He was a little bit saddened, but after the conversation was over, both of my parents agree with my decision and support me 100%.

Here's why they support me:  *I have a very high chance of giving any of my potential children bipolar disorder.*  While this is a factor in my decision, I also just do not want children, so it was more of a nail in the coffin.

Bipolar disorder has been prevalent in my family for the past 4 generations.  My sister (27) suffers from it (it truly is suffering), 2 of my mother's 4 siblings suffer from it, 2 of my maternal grandfather's siblings suffered from it, and even his aunt (my great great aunt) suffered from it.  My mother even has cousins with bipolar disorder.  Here's the kicker - nobody in my family with bipolar disorder has ever had children.  Every time, this has been passed on by someone without it.  Of the people in my extended family who do have the disorder, only two are living relatively happily on medicine.  Two have killed themselves, one has killed someone else, and many abuse drugs in attempts to self-medicate.  

[I forgot to mention - anyone who has had more than one kid in this line of genetics has ended up producing a bipolar child.  I have two cousins who are only children, who are in perfect mental health.  ""Oh, so just have one child then!"" (nobody actually said this) My sister was a first child, genetics don't care about birth order.]  

My parents had never made the connection of who passed down the mental illness through the family prior to our discussion. Having dealt with my sister for the past 9 years with her illness, my mother said to me ""You are alive, and I care more about you right now than any unborn child you might have.  I would never wish the emotional and mental anguish on you, that we have gone through with [sister].  I care about a child dealing with this disorder, but right now I care more about you.""

She mentioned financial burden also - they have spent at least $10k in the past year or two helping my sister with hospital bills (she has suffered from delusions and been admitted multiple times), rent, food, and etc.

While this isn't the only reason my husband and I choose to be childfree, it certainly helps to have a family who understands.  (This is also why the gynecologist had no problem setting me up for Essure while I'm ""so young"")

How did you finally make the choice to become sterilized?,"I’m 28 years old and I have Mirena. However, it needs to be replaced this summer and I’m considering tubal ligation instead. I don’t want, nor have I ever wanted, children. I’m one of those weirdos who has known this even as a child - my mom always jokes about how I would play “house” because I would give her all the dolls, get a briefcase, and say “here you go, I’m going to work now” 😂 Anyway, I’m not sure about surgery. I know I don’t want kids but currently weighing the pros and cons of surgery. I don’t want essure or the clamps because of nightmares I’ve heard about both, but I’d be interested to hear stories of different sterilization methods &amp; experiences. 

Those of you who have had the procedure... were you 100% confident in this decision? Did you ever have doubts? How did you know it was right for you? Do you have any regrets?

I deal with mental health issues and I don’t want to be on a hormonal birth control. I also don’t want paragard to make my cramps and period complete shit. My partner doesn’t have insurance to have a vasectomy right now, and probably won’t for a few years. However, my insurance will cover the costs of a ligation.

"(SFW) Well, this happened at the gyno office [xpost from 2XC]","BACKSTORY:

When I got this job, the first thing I did with my fancy new health insurance was go see the gyno. I had not had insurance for about 13 years so I was super stoked and I was ready to get off the Pill and onto something more long term. My husband and I are not having kids (no, not ever) so I was looking into a tubal + ablation or Essure.

Long story short, the gyno was awesome about not having babies but admitted that her superiors required a lot of hoops to jump through for a patient in my situation who wanted permanent sterilization so we decided that the Mirena was the best option for me right now. Insurance covered it, it was easy to get and is just as effective as the permanent measures. I got the IUD a week later, it sucked for a day but otherwise not a big deal and we set up a time for me to come back in a month to check things out.

THE ACTUAL STORY:

At my one month checkup, I asked the receptionist if she knew if I'd be getting an ultrasound for the IUD. She did not know and asked me to tell her on my way out.

I went in for the checkup, everything was fine and we did not do an ultrasound. On my way out, it had gotten a bit more crowded and the receptionist was helping someone else so I just waved and kept walking. She saw me and called out ""Did you get the ultrasound?"" and I replied ""No, not today"" and she then said ""Oh well, maybe next time!"" and we said bye and I left.

I was waiting for the elevator with about 3-5 other people and a woman who had left right behind me walks up, places one hand on my shoulder and stands on the other side, effectively trapping me while she puts her other hand on my lower abdomen and coos ""Oh poor baby, they'll take your picture next time!"". I was frozen in shock at first but regained my senses enough to say (in a level-but-horrified voice) ""I'm not pregnant, I just got an IUD placed.""

Pause.

Recoil.

Withdraw.

She didn't even apologize, she just froze, stepped away and didn't look at me. I followed her into the elevator and she stood as far away as she could.

Had Essure in July. Just got my dye test to confirm the tubes are fully blocked. SUCCESS at 25!,"I won't lie to the women in this sub who are thinking about Essure. The dye test hurt. I cried a bit, but they were very nice and it was over with very quickly.

Surprisingly, the initial insertion of the catheter to push the dye into my uterus didn't hurt at all...it was the dye that hurt. It fills up your womb with pressurized liquid. Felt like really bad sudden cramps.

Are you shocked at Netflix show featuring Essure?,"I recently read that Bayer was taking Essure off the market.

Some concerns I feel i should address with like-minded folk [25f],"So, this is my first post. Also, on a mobile, sorry if it looks cruddy. 

#1) Any younger women have tubal ligation/Essure/etc? I'd like to hear your pros and cons. Also, over the past few years, when I go in for my yearly checkups, I discuss how different BC options have given me trouble, and that I still have a lot of anxiety about getting pregnant, I ask about sterilization. The only things I ever hear are essentially ""Good luck getting anyone to take you seriously about it til you're at least 30."" Is there anything I can do to get them to agree to do it? I knew I haven't wanted children since I still was one myself, but so many doctors won't do it for fear I'll change my mind, or whatever their reasoning may be. 

2) Im pretty sure that one of the main reasons my ex-fiance left me is because he decided he wanted kids, when he knew I wasn't in to it. Since then I have this anxiety that I'll won't find someone, that somehow, I've severely limited my options for a partner by being deadset anti-baby. That even if at first, someone was on the same page, after some unknown amount of time invested in a relationship, they'll change their mind. Anyone have a similar experience, or maybe some kind of reassurance to make me stop being a worry-wart?

"""So you're having infertility problems?""","This morning I had to have an X-ray done to confirm my Essure procedure was successful. The doc who came in to insert the catheter wasn't my usual OB/GYN, and without reading any of my paperwork she introduced herself and asked ""so we're doing this test because you have concerns about being infertile?""

I just stared blankly at her for a minute, laughed and said ""Well I had Essure done so yeah, kinda hoping I'm infertile now."" 

The other nurses and techs chuckled too because I had just explained my whole CF/fence-sitter stance and they were very supportive of it, surprisingly enough.

The doc however was a little taken aback by my bluntness and was like ""oh, okay, so this is something that you wanted I suppose"". As if she had only seen women who struggled to get pregnant and had never had a patient who was so adamant about never getting pregnant.

My husband went retarded?,"Well, I've been looking at tubal ligation and essure. I'm more inclined to go for tubal ligation, but that's another story. Anyway, my husband of 10 years and I were in the car. I was going to ask him what he thought about the topic. In the 10 years we've been together, we've talked about children, and we've always decided we did not want them due to the fact we both had horrible parents, genetic factors, physical factors (both from accidents and skeletal that would make giving birth hard for me!!!), and generally we don't think we'd be good parents due to the fact we don't have the patience. Anyway, back to the story. So, I ask him what he thinks about the whole kid situation. His answer: ""yeah, I think I'd like a kid."" His reasoning is he loves our dogs. I remind him children are not dogs. In fact, he resents one of our dogs due to the fact one of our current dogs was rescued during the final 8 months of the life of the life if our first dog. Resentment for something the dog had NO control over and the fact we didn't even know our first dog was even ill to the point he was going to pass away were no her problem!!! How can he feel like he could handle a child. I'll be damned if I'd have a kid with somebody that would hold a grudge toward an animal over something they had nothing to do with in the first place. WTF. I reminded him of all of the negatives. Do men have biological clocks?!?!?!?! He's 41 and I'm 32. I sincerely have no desire to reproduce. I have made this clear so many times, and he has agreed so many times. What could have changed his mind? He's seen the same things I have! He knows we have no support system in the fact both of our parents don't even talk to us. We would be 100% alone, and I think we're too selfish and set in our ways. He doesn't like other peoples' children since he was molested as a child even. How would he do with his own? Oh, and he's also made comments about how he wouldn't love a child that would misbehave. What's the point!??!?!?!?!?! I don't think I'm the confused one in my stance. How do I make him realize he needs to get back on the right side of the fence????? God, what a fucking nightmare.

I STILL dread coming home.,"Hey CF.

So about a month or so ago I made a post about these new neighbors that moved in, they all have young children who all play together in the apartment square that all our apartments face. 

These children are so obnoxiously loud and rude and they slam their fucking doors so loud in the morning, afternoon, and evening my apartment rattles and they give me so much anxiety I wound up dropping the class I was taking because I had nowhere else to study but my home and my grade was dropping.

I have no idea what to do. I’ve complained to the manager of the complex, and I’m not sure if they ever spoke to the parents because nothing has changed. I spoke with another resident, a kind older woman who has lived here for 10 years and she said she complained about the children’s behavior as well, but again, nothing has changed. My bf and I are very quiet and very respectful of the other neighbors. I think our dishwasher makes the most noise of anything we do.

I’ve never seen the parents of these children supervising, the most I’ve seen is the young mother of the Monster (what I call the worst child) berating one of the other children (not her own) for picking on her kid or something.

Should I leave a note for them explaining how obnoxious they are being? In kind words of course. I think the behavior of these children as well as how distant the parents are is downright deplorable.

I scheduled an appointment with my OB on Monday to explore getting my tubes tied because while I’ve always been CF, this situation has allowed me to be 100% confident in my decision on never having biological children. However, I’m extremely allergic to nickel and copper so IUDs are out, as well as Essure so I’m not entirely sure what options I have.

Is anyone using ESSURE? ,"I just discovered this subreddit (love it completely!) and noticed a link in a reply for Essure.  Is anyone using this?  I'm considering my options currently and have thought about an IUD or vasectomy for my partner (don't worry, he's willing).

"""I'm sorry, I can't do it. I'm CF too but that's the rules in this country""","Hi guys!

I have a story for you. Not really a rant, not at all a rave, just a story of what happened to me last week.

I've had my implanon taken off a few months ago because i lost a lot of weight and the hormones went all crazy. I had a few cysts as well so my gyno told me to stop all BC for a while and when everything is back to normal, get a copper IUD fitted.

The thing is, she's an expensive gyno and also it's very difficult to have an appointment with her. So since everything went back to normal, i have been unable to get an appointment with her during my periods (because they all want to have the IUD put on during periods)

So this summer, during my holidays, I got a bit flirty, finally met someone really nice, we had a nice night together.... and the condom broke...

I took plan B, then my periods didn't come back. I was terrified, despite having taken multiple pregnancy tests that were all negative.

So i went to a planned parenthood centre in my area and they did a blood test. Not pregnant (thank god! i was ready to ask for an abortion here and there!). 

And i discussed with the doctor there to ask if it's possible to have an appointment quickly to get an IUD fitted. She said there is no problem, but they need to do tests first to check if everything is ok (planned parenthood is extremely cheap here, and social security refunds almost everything, so no problem for me)

So I had an appointment last week for that (everything ok), I have my prescription for the IUD, now waiting for my next periods to start.

The doctor I saw (different doctor) really took the time to explain everything to me. He was really nice and informative. Really great guy.

So, i thought I would just ask.... I KNEW he was going to say no, but i asked nevertheless: ""what about sterilization?""

Now, my country (Belgium) is very open minded to a lot of stuff. Abortion has been legal here for decades. You can ask for euthanasia (a lot of very strict rules, but it's possible), marriage for same-sex people has been authorised for more than 15 years, gay people can adopt, single people and lesbians can have IVF treatments etc. Anyway, we have a lot of freedom, which is great.

But, for sterilization, he told me it would not be accepted.

Essure has been banned in Belgium at the beginning of this year because of the side-effects being too dangerous apparently. So the only other sterilization methods are tubals or hysterectomy which involve an hospitalization and anesthesia.

He said: ""if you were sick, like cancer on your ovaries, and it was the only way to save your life, we would do it without even thinking about it. But since your organs are healthy and you are under 40 years old, and never had a kid before, no doctor would allow it. It's like you were coming to a surgeon's office and ask for an appendicectomy. You're not ill, so the danger of putting you under anesthesia is too high, it would be refused. There is always a risk...""

I replied ""well ok. But i don't want children""

To what he replied ""I know that... i've never wanted children myself either so i honestly understand your stance. But it's the rules and I have no choice. We don't offer sterilizations at planned parenthood anyway, you would need to ask to a surgeon about it. And you can do it if you want, just know you would waste your time. But don't worry the IUD is pretty reliable too"".

I was not angry as I know i have other solutions and I was pretty decided to get an IUD anyway. And i understand the point of view too. My mum was telling me about an old friend of her who hated the way he looked, saved money to have a nose job and died on the table because he had a bad reaction to the anesthesia and his heart just stopped beating. He died during cosmetic surgery. Not even something serious... so I understand his point. It's just that even in Belgium, men can get a vasectomy pretty easily, even if they haven't had a kid before.... so the feminist in me doesn't really like the sexism it implies....",childfree,2017-10-25 11:44:48,hi guy story really rant rave story happened last week implanon taken month ago lost lot weight hormone went crazy cyst well gyno told stop bc everything back normal copper iud fitted thing expensive gyno also difficult appointment since everything went back normal unable appointment period want iud put period summer holiday got bit flirty finally met someone really nice nice night together condom broke took plan b period come back terrified despite taken multiple pregnancy test negative went planned parenthood centre area blood test pregnant thank god ready ask abortion discussed doctor ask possible appointment quickly iud fitted said problem need test first check everything ok planned parenthood extremely cheap social security refund almost everything problem appointment last week everything ok prescription iud waiting next period start doctor saw different doctor really took time explain everything really nice informative really great guy thought ask knew going say asked nevertheless sterilization country belgium open minded lot stuff abortion legal decade ask euthanasia lot strict rule possible marriage people authorised year gay people adopt single people lesbian ivf treatment etc anyway lot freedom great sterilization told accepted banned belgium beginning year dangerous apparently sterilization method tubals hysterectomy involve hospitalization anesthesia said sick like cancer ovary way save life without even thinking since organ healthy year old never kid doctor allow like coming surgeon office ask appendicectomy ill danger putting anesthesia high refused always risk replied well want child replied know never wanted child either honestly understand stance rule choice offer sterilization planned parenthood anyway need ask surgeon want know waste time worry iud pretty reliable angry know solution pretty decided iud anyway understand point view mum telling old friend hated way looked saved money nose job died table bad reaction anesthesia heart stopped beating died cosmetic surgery even something serious understand point even belgium men vasectomy pretty easily even kid feminist really like sexism implies,sorry ca cf rule country,"""I'm sorry, I can't do it.

We don't offer sterilizations at planned parenthood anyway, you would need to ask to a surgeon about it. And you can do it if you want, just know you would waste your time. But don't worry the IUD is pretty reliable too"".

I was not angry as I know i have other solutions and I was pretty decided to get an IUD anyway. And i understand the point of view too. My mum was telling me about an old friend of her who hated the way he looked, saved money to have a nose job and died on the table because he had a bad reaction to the anesthesia and his heart just stopped beating. He died during cosmetic surgery. Not even something serious... so I understand his point. It's just that even in Belgium, men can get a vasectomy pretty easily, even if they haven't had a kid before.... so the feminist in me doesn't really like the sexism it implies....",sorry ca cf rule country hi guy story really rant rave story happened last week implanon taken month ago lost lot weight hormone went crazy cyst well gyno told stop bc everything back normal copper iud fitted thing expensive gyno also difficult appointment since everything went back normal unable appointment period want iud put period summer holiday got bit flirty finally met someone really nice nice night together condom broke took plan b period come back terrified despite taken multiple pregnancy test negative went planned parenthood centre area blood test pregnant thank god ready ask abortion discussed doctor ask possible appointment quickly iud fitted said problem need test first check everything ok planned parenthood extremely cheap social security refund almost everything problem appointment last week everything ok prescription iud waiting next period start doctor saw different doctor really took time explain everything really nice informative really great guy thought ask knew going say asked nevertheless sterilization country belgium open minded lot stuff abortion legal decade ask euthanasia lot strict rule possible marriage people authorised year gay people adopt single people lesbian ivf treatment etc anyway lot freedom great sterilization told accepted banned belgium beginning year dangerous apparently sterilization method tubals hysterectomy involve hospitalization anesthesia said sick like cancer ovary way save life without even thinking since organ healthy year old never kid doctor allow like coming surgeon office ask appendicectomy ill danger putting anesthesia high refused always risk replied well want child replied know never wanted child either honestly understand stance rule choice offer sterilization planned parenthood anyway need ask surgeon want know waste time worry iud pretty reliable angry know solution pretty decided iud anyway understand point view mum telling old friend hated way looked saved money nose job died table bad reaction anesthesia heart stopped beating died cosmetic surgery even something serious understand point even belgium men vasectomy pretty easily even kid feminist really like sexism implies
Looking for opinions on IUDs and Sterilization from women who have had the first then gotten the second.,"TLDR: toe in the water on dating after 8-years, need help deciding on a new birth control method. 

After some terrible choices in men in my twenties I decided to take a year off from dating and sex to help re-introduce me to myself.  At the time I also found myself unemployed with a BC prescription running out. So I let it lapse and one year became eight.  In those eight years, I've had sex once and we used a condom. 

Prior to those eight years I was on Ortho and hated how it made me feel - I was depressed a lot (combination guy choices and extra hormones possibly?) and switched to the ring.

So, now I have my toe in the dating pool again and that's going to mean sex at some point in the nearish future. 

I have always known that I don't want kids. At all. But thanks to societal pressure never found a doctor willing to do a tubal ligation when I was younger. I'm now 35 and am considering that, Essure, or a copper IUD as I'd rather not use a hormone based way of not getting in a family way. I've done research, see pros and cons to all of them: what I'm looking for is women who have had a IUD and then gotten sterilized.

My issues with them are basically - ""invasive surgery not a particularly thrilling experience"" and ""foreign body in me for a long time, gross!""  And I can't decide which is the better way to go.  I'd love to hear if women who had an IUD then got sterilized would go straight for a tubal ligation if they could go back in time with the knowledge they have now. Of if they wished they had just continued to use an IUD.

I’m 31 and I have to have a hysterectomy,"I’m child free so this isn’t horribly heart breaking for me, but it still blows my mind. 

In 2019, at 29, I had a bilateral salpingectomy(tube removal) and an uterine ablation to deal with my periods. I am not a candidate for hormonal birth control, and in 2016 I had Essure placed. It worked fine, but it started to cause pain after a little while so I opted for the tubal and ablation. 

An uterine ablation is where they shock/burn the endometrium to create scar tissue so you no longer have a period. It worked instantly. I was in Heaven! No more periods! 

That was in October of 2019, and last year, around September, I began having cyclical type pain. However, it was so dull I couldn’t tell if it was actually cyclical or if I was just constipated. I still mentioned it to my OBGYN, and he said he wanted to do an ultrasound just to be sure nothing was amiss. When I had my ultrasound about a month later—thanks, insurance—the pain had started again, so they were able to see what is happening every month. 

The ultrasound showed that I am bleeding behind my scar tissue, and the blood is trapped. It cannot get out. This causes my uterus to dilate and swell. The only fix is a hysterectomy. Thanks to insurance I haven’t been able to get one yet. 

Every month the pain gets worse, and the cycles last longer. I asked my OBGYN to prescribe me something for the pain, and they said, “we don’t prescribe pain medicine. Take 800mg of ibuprofen every 12 hours, as needed.”

This month I ended up in the ER three times in four days. The first hospital I was sent to by my GP, and they did nothing except give me toradol. They did no follow up imaging or any other testing. Just gave me toradol and sent me home. 

The next night the pain was unbearable. It was so bad I begged my husband to kill me. The only thing I could do at that point was ride out the pain until it ended—when the pain hits it will typically last for about five hours, have a two hour break, and then return. 

The next morning I went to a different hospital. At the second hospital they did some imaging, and gave me some medicine to calm me down and something for pain. Whatever they gave me knocked me out. When I woke up they were telling me I was good to go home. My husband brought me home, and around 10:30 that night I got a frantic phone call from the hospital I had been to. It was the radiologist’s secretary calling to tell me that I was in fact NOT okay to go home, and if I started to hurt again I MUST return. A few hours later we were on our way back to the hospital. 

I was admitted for two days while they tried to control my pain. If we didn’t stay out in front of the pain it was uncontrollable. They would give me toradol, Tylenol, percocet, and dilaudid. Nothing would kill it once it started. I would just writhe in the bed, and scream and cry until it ended. 

The doctor came to me and told me he was going to schedule a hysterectomy for the next day. Later that day the nurse came and told me they were planning it for that night instead. Later again, the doctor came in and told me he couldn’t get my insurance to approve the surgery. I would have to wait. He said he could perform it as an emergency, but then there was also no guarantee insurance would pay for that either. 

They ended up discharging me instead, with dilaudid to take home as well as the medication Orilissa to send me into early menopause to hopefully stop the bleeding. I am currently in limbo with the insurance company trying to get the surgery approved. 

I wanted to type all of this out to let everyone know of post ablation syndrome. Your endometrium tries to grow back, and you literally hemorrhage behind scar tissue and the blood is trapped. 

No one told me that 30% of people who have ablations end up with post ablation syndrome. It only took 2 years for my ablation to fail, and this is the worst pain I have ever been in. The OBGYN at the hospital told me people who have had children compare the pain to natural child birth.

"Need some empathy, support and looking for long-term experiences with tubal ligation for young women?","Hi Everyone,

I've read this Reddit since I was 19 years old or so (26 now). Ever since I can remember I know I've never wanted to have children. It was wonderful to find this Reddit and see other people who felt the same as me and had the same goals in life. I felt so alone in this it was great to be understood.

I am posting because in a year or so I'm getting married, and that means I will become sexually active for the first time. I never have been physically intimate with anyone. I purposely avoided it, with one of the main reasons being I didn't want to risk ever having kids.

That's not necessarily going to be possible anymore, and frankly I would want to have that intimacy with my partner. I want to get sterilized, and I'm looking for long-term stories of people's experiences with different types of permanent/long term contraceptive. For example, bilateral salpingectomy, tubal ligation, Essure, or IUD.  I'm asking this because I've read that for younger women getting permanent sterilized has some increased long term risks. I am afraid of dying in surgery or other exaggerated things my doctor has told me.

It's important for me to have the lowest risk of pregnancy possible, 0% is a good number. I have had a history of anxiety and depression, and used to have an eating disorder. If I got pregnant ever I wouldn't be able to emotionally cope.

Speaking of doctors, My experiences with getting permanently sterilized have been the usual bullshit. What if you change your mind etc?

When I was 21 I found a doctor to give me a bilateral salpingectomy, only to have his nurse ask me on the day of surgery, ""are you sure you want your ovaries out?"" YEEEEAAAAAH NO THANKS BRO

So for a long time I just didn't think about it. I led a very isolated life because I was scared of something happening if I ever got in a relationship. I didn't date or anything. Now I'm getting married, my partner is going to be sterile and we'll use condoms, pull out, diaphragm, IUD etc, I just still don't feel comfortable. 

Recently I've been trying to learn more and restudy the material. I went to a doctor a few weeks ago who begrudgingly agreed to sterilize me but suggested an IUD first. She also told me its unknown if long-term women who get sterilized have problems. She said they usually do it for people who are 35. Funny, my doctor at 21 said its for people around my current age (27-29).

Right now I'm feeling particularly upset because I just talked to a nurse practitioner about my school to understand her experiences and what she has seen long term and she told me I'd change my mind so I yelled at her.

So Reddit, would you please help me out? I'm concerned about long-term effects of permanent sterilization on young women (5+ years out or more). Can anyone share or help?

I just had my consult to get fixed!,"Hello lovely people of childfree! I thought I should share with you my wonderful news I learned this afternoon.

So I am a 21 about to be 22 year old female, and I just scheduled my Essure procedure for December 2nd of this year.

I began the process over a year ago after my second copper IUD had to be taken out because of how horrible the periods were. I had been on countless different BC pills, I had tried depo, the Nuva ring, two implanon implants and one nexplanon implant and two copper IUDs. Every method I experienced horrible side effects, be it weight gain, acne, mood swings, spotting or bad periods. I told my OB/GYN I wanted to get fixed and at first she said no. But then I gave her my list of reasons and pestered the fuck out of her and she said I needed to talk to my therapist about it,  have her confirm that I'm making a stable, rational decision and that I would have to wait about a year after I turned 21. The year passed, and earlier this year I got pregnant and miscarried within three days and I was relieved I didn't have to get an abortion like I had been planning. Needless to say, my feelings haven't changed.

Now, what I'm about to say might tickle some bootys, but I'm technically -gulp-  a fence sitter. During my appointment today I told my doctor that yes, you're right, my feelings towards having children might change down the line, because I don't know where I'm going to be in my 30s or 40s. However, my feelings towards having biological children AREN'T going to change and here are my reasons why:


1.) Overpopulation/global warming- I don't feel morally right about bringing life into this world when there are so many lives that already need homes and I don't know what the state of the world is going to be in 20, 30 years from now. Having a biological child leaves a horrible eco-footprint on the planet compared to adoption/foster care.

2.) Career choices- I work with children, and I love what I do. I also love that work stays at work and at the end of the day, the kids go home, and I go home and I can do whatever I damn well please and I don't have to worry about caring for another human being. And if I did decide down the line I wanted to adopt or foster, I would have to change careers because there's no way in hell I'm going to have the energy and means to come home to a kid and care for it after being around children all day. I like my career path and I don't want to change that any time soon.

3.) Biology- I love kids, I HATE babies. Some are cute, most are disgusting, screaming, crying, poopy, squish beings that are the spawn of Satan himself. If I could somehow create a mini half human me and skip infancy, I'd be all for it, but that's not how biology works.

4.) Pregnancy- After already briefly experiencing pregnancy I do not need to ever experience that horror again. I'm sorry (not sorry) but I'm selfish. I don't want my body to go through the drastic changes that pregnancy causes. I would like to keep my vagina and tattoos I've spent a lot of money on in tact, I don't want anymore stretch marks than I have, and I don't ever want to push a watermelon out of my lemon hole, thank you very much. I also know I'd be at high risk for post partum depression and I already hate babies as it is, I can't imagine what I would be like if I gave birth to one.

5.) Genetics- I love my older brother more than I love myself. But I do not have what it takes to raise a child who is on the autism spectrum and I have the utmost respect for my parents because they did the best they could as young parents at raising us. My chances of having a child with autism are a lot higher, and addiction, mental, and physical disabilities run rampant through both sides of my family. Again, I don't feel right about bringing a child like that into the world when there are already so many disabled kids that are left unwanted.


With all of this in mind, there are literally more reasons for me not to biologically reproduce than to have kids. So if for some magical reason down the line I want to have children, adoption is always an option. But again, that's a huge if.


So in a few weeks I'll have a phone appointment to discuss the procedure again, confirm that this is what I really want again, then I will get progestin to thin the lining of my uterus so that it will be easier for the camera to see my tubes for the procedure.


Then on December 2nd I go in at 8 AM and my Essure procedure is at 9. If for some reason the coils don't want to go in, I'll have to go back in a month for them to try again. If that still doesn't work, then we will begin the process for me to get the tubes taken out completely. 


This is covered by MediCal, as it's considered a preventive procedure. I'm so excited, happy and nervous all at once I feel like I could cry. Ladies, if you're firm about your decision to be CF, and you want to get fixed, make it happen. Be prepared to jump through a lot of hoops, but stay strong and determined.

Hello lovely people of childfree! I thought I should share with you my wonderful news I learned this afternoon.

So I am a 21 about to be 22 year old female, and I just scheduled my Essure procedure for December 2nd of this year.

I began the process over a year ago after my second copper IUD had to be taken out because of how horrible the periods were. I had been on countless different BC pills, I had tried depo, the Nuva ring, two implanon implants and one nexplanon implant and two copper IUDs. Every method I experienced horrible side effects, be it weight gain, acne, mood swings, spotting or bad periods. I told my OB/GYN I wanted to get fixed and at first she said no. But then I gave her my list of reasons and pestered the fuck out of her and she said I needed to talk to my therapist about it,  have her confirm that I'm making a stable, rational decision and that I would have to wait about a year after I turned 21. The year passed, and earlier this year I got pregnant and miscarried within three days and I was relieved I didn't have to get an abortion like I had been planning. Needless to say, my feelings haven't changed.

Now, what I'm about to say might tickle some bootys, but I'm technically -gulp-  a fence sitter. During my appointment today I told my doctor that yes, you're right, my feelings towards having children might change down the line, because I don't know where I'm going to be in my 30s or 40s. However, my feelings towards having biological children AREN'T going to change and here are my reasons why:


1.) Overpopulation/global warming- I don't feel morally right about bringing life into this world when there are so many lives that already need homes and I don't know what the state of the world is going to be in 20, 30 years from now. Having a biological child leaves a horrible eco-footprint on the planet compared to adoption/foster care.

2.) Career choices- I work with children, and I love what I do. I also love that work stays at work and at the end of the day, the kids go home, and I go home and I can do whatever I damn well please and I don't have to worry about caring for another human being. And if I did decide down the line I wanted to adopt or foster, I would have to change careers because there's no way in hell I'm going to have the energy and means to come home to a kid and care for it after being around children all day. I like my career path and I don't want to change that any time soon.

3.) Biology- I love kids, I HATE babies. Some are cute, most are disgusting, screaming, crying, poopy, squish beings that are the spawn of Satan himself. If I could somehow create a mini half human me and skip infancy, I'd be all for it, but that's not how biology works.

Old gy and sterilisation angerisation,"So, I'm 23 and living in Italy. Been wanting to be sterilized for yeaaars now but couldn't yet (not independent /0cash). I actually decided that I want a total hysterectomy (without the removal of ovaries) but I realized that, since women who actually really need it and live a life of pain struggle to actually get it, I will probably fight for it for the rest of my life because I'm healthy. So I decided for now to focus on bilateral salpingectomy.

I thought of waiting until I move in another country but nothing is set in stone, it might take me yeaaars. So I decided to start now, in the hope of getting it by the time I'm 25.


I had the displeasure of talking with the head of gyns in the hospital next door for a complaint I had, he tried to sweeten me up with ""I'm a family person, I loooove all women, I see them as mothers sisters Yada Yada"" and then he added ""I see you as a granddaughter"". I wanted to gag. Last thing I want is to imagine him near a vagina with his male old hands, especially a young lady he sees as a granddaughter...

Towards the end of the discussion he tried to sound open, in case I have questions on female health, and I thought of asking information about sterilisation in Italy.

Dude straight up went into a tirade about how I'm young, how I should find an understanding and loving male partner who will use condoms. Mansplained me how to use and test condoms for leakage, and how I should use plan b if it's broken.

Dude, you sound like a pervert pedo. I asked information on sterilisation, not your goddamn opinion on my reproductive choices.

I also found out it's almost impossible to get a sterilisation in Italy. I find no options or 1-2 (if lucky) per city and all its essure or ligation which is not what I want, I want the salpingectomy which is the best one. I tried the ones on the list, the one in Verona forces his patients to get ultrasounds (the not fun ones) to be accepted for sterilisation and it would make me relive a trauma that it's taking me months to just manage with. Tried every way possible of finding a way around it, even anesthesia with the authorisation of my therapist, nada. He is stuck on his personal reinforced rules. Second one from Milano didn't answer yet to my mail, I'll see if I can get a reply. But it is pretty much my last choice. I dread if he says no or that he has same stupid rules. 

Also, why is it that every male gynecologist I see online or in rl are old guys? The whole experience is already awful, it's even worse seeing an old guy probing around and having opinions when they don't even have an uterus. 
I'm okay with male doctors and surgeons, but this part should be just women. It feels degrading enough as it is.

Tubal ligation from Planned Parenthood? How much of a process is it?,"I've seen on Planned Parenthood's website that some locations can do an essure tubal ligation and I would really like get it done.

So my question is, if I go to a Planned Parenthood to get sterilized, how much of a process is it? Is there a load of paperwork or multiple visits required or anything like that? If I am near a Planned Parenthood location for less than two weeks, will that be enough time to get it done?

Essure Consult Update,"Some may remember my previous post awhile back about an Essure consultation.  Well, it was today, and it didn't exactly go as planned.

My reproductive health services via Planned Parenthood are covered by the state because I (technically) make no income.  However, before I signed anything, the clinician told me that if I went ahead and got sterilized, the state would no longer cover any services -- well woman exam, STI testing, etc.  Nothing.  This was not wholly unexpected, as a Redditor had warned me of such a thing in my previous post, but I hadn't really considered an alternative if it were to happen to me.  Thankfully, the clinician was incredibly nice and we went over some other options.

We decided on ParaGuard (copper IUD).  It's no-hormone, which I love because I've been on the Depo shot for over three years, and the long-term use of hormones along with potential bone density loss concerns me.  It's just as effective as Essure, lasts for 12 years, maintenance-free aside from the monthly string check, and I can still continue to receive other services at no cost.  I decided it was a good choice all in all, even though I was disappointed that I couldn't get the Essure.  So the IUD will be placed in ten days.

Thanks to everyone for your well wishes and kind words.

5. Do you feel it during sex? (me and my boyfriend are rather rough :$)

{RANT} Doctor wants notes from my counselor and my psychiatrist before setting yet another consultation for Essure,"I had a pretty standard Bad Experience yesterday at a new gynecologist. This is the 3rd I've gone to that won't perform Essure on a woman with no kids. I'm 29 btw. They sure did a nice job of tricking me into thinking that they'd consider it, though. 

I've been sexually active for 10 years and have taken every BC known to man. 

5 or so different tricyclic pills - hate sex, water retention, bad mood swings

Mini-pill: I'm 6' and 200lb so too heavy

The patch: heart palpitations

Mirena: Expelled

Paragard: made sex excruciating

Nuvaring: murdered sex drive, even worse mood swings

Depo-Provera: gained 60 pounds and my hair fell out

The nurse practitioner I saw talked a big game about respecting women's autonomy, followed immediately by ""we just want to protect you from making a mistake"". Lots of namby-pamby bingo platitudes about ""it's the rest of your liiiiiife! most women regret it!"" She went to talk to a doctor who said I needed one-on-one consultations with both her AND the medical director, plus notarized letters from my counselor and my psychiatrist to make sure I was ""stable enough to be trusted with this decision"".

I asked about getting fitted for a diaphragm and she said she didn't know how and couldn't recommend anyone who did. I asked her for any advice and she said, ""I guess use condoms and withdrawal"". Lol what a joke. I've been in a relationship for six years and I'm stick with oral and rubbery-smelling sex that makes my urinary tract burn. I nodded my head through her suggestion I make a follow-up appointment and left without bothering.

Then her office had the nerve to call me to schedule a follow-up. I told the woman straight-up ""It costs me fifty bucks every time I want to see a doctor. I don't make enough money to patronize an office where the staff treats me like a juvenile. I won't jump through hoops for a medical procedure."" Then I sat in my car for an hour and cried.

Good news! The doctor thinks I'm capable of making my own decisions... Now... Advice needed/wanted.,"Yay! After my previous post here ( http://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/2yju43/at_the_gyno_so_your_family_is_complete_then/ ) my doctor gave me a call back, he apparently tried a couple of times before, but I'm horrible with phones, so I missed him a couple of times and they're not allowed to leave any messages...

So, anyway, he told me I could have a tubal! :D OMG! I'M ALLOWED PERMANENT BIRTH CONTROL! :D

However, I did ask for an Essure, since it's non-surgical, no scars, no recovery times, those sorts of things, and he would figure out (he told me at the appointment) when it would be available here (NHS website states it as an option, but apparently not all hospitals offer it..). Of course he forgot/didn't ask, so when I asked about the Essure he repeated it wasn't available, and I asked again if he would check for me: if it will become available in the next year or so I'd be willing to wait, what is another year... 

But, if it doesn't... I think I'd have to go with the tubal, because I don't want to wait much longer than a year or so, especially if they're not sure when Essure will be available, and I could end up waiting 'forever'....

Any ideas/tips/experiences here with the NHS and tubals vs Essure? Also, is it under NHS coverage, does anyone know? I didn't get that far yet with my research, before I started digging I wanted to be sure it would actually be an option!

"Brought up being childfree with a friend today, and did not get the reaction I expected.","I [18F] live in a pretty liberal, and open minded place, and most of my friends share those ideals with me. I've known I've wanted to be childfree for pretty much my entire life. My mom knows it and supports the idea and a few of my close friends do as well. Ever since hearing about Planned Parenthood performing Essure on women over 18 with little to no hassel, I've been anxious to get the procedure done as I am 100% confident I never want children. 

Well my best friend [18F] recently came back after a long vacation and we were talking about new things in our lives. She told me that her family is adopting a child that her extended family can't take care of, if that makes any sense. Although it was ultimately her parents decision, she was the one pushing the decision. She lamented on the fact that this meant she wouldn't be getting her own car, wouldn't be able to join me backpacking across Europe next summer, wouldn't be able to go to university out of state like she had dreamed, and would most likely be living at home and going to community college. 

And then she said she was happy because she would be helping her family. Coming from a girl who's only dream was to get out of this town, it was crazy to listen to! She then went on to talk about how she can't wait to have kids of her own, and I casually brought up that I didn't think I would ever have kids and wanted to get Essure done in a few months when I had enough money saved. 

Big mistake, apparently. 

She started saying how I would regret it, how I would change my mind, how I would be a great mother (Totally untrue; I have zero patience for children, don't like them at all, was bad enough to get fired from a babysitting gig), and basically her rejecting my life choices. My favorite part was when she asked ""how are you supposed to be remembered?"" and reminded me of the post about leaving a legacy. This was hard enough coming from my best friend, so I just calmly stated the reasons I would be a shit mom, how I wanted to travel and have money and free time, how if you have to use breeding to be remembered your life wasn't worth much anyways, and how I wasn't sure if I even wanted to get married. 

I thought I outlined my goals and reasons why pretty neatly, and thought she would understand and accept my choices. Nope! Instead she went on about how it was okay I didn't want my own kids, and how I would be the best *adoptive* mother ever! Wat? I never once said anything about adopting kids, or *just* not wanting to go through pregnancy, but apparently I'm only afraid of the pain of childbirth and secretly want to have children. 

This whole thing was so frustrating to me. Not that I needed my best friend's blessing per se, but I was hoping for her to be the one to help me through the process of getting sterilized. Ever since I told her she's made it a point to say how good of an adoptive mother I would be, and other comments like that. It's so frustrating! She was the last person I would expect to make a fuss about my choices, but it turns out she's the one with the biggest problem. 

Oh well. I'm still going to get the procedure done in the near future and if she doesn't support me, I'll find somebody who does.

EDIT: Some explanation about why I added the story about my friend's family's adoption. It was just so weird to see somebody I actually know willingly throw their plans away in order to be involved with a child. Since she's an adult legally, I figured she would not be involved and go to a school out of state like she wanted, but instead is super enthusiastic about being involved in the adopted child's life. I didn't mean to sound like a bitch about it. It was just so sudden and weird to see it happening. And hearing about how she was giving up her dreams for a child that isn't even her's was reinforcement for me being childfree. Sorry for offending anyone, I guess?

EDIT II: I guess people aren't getting that my friend was a driving force for deciding whether or not to adopt. It wasn't as if her parents said ""we're adopting another child, deal with it."" Her parents were on the fence about it because they already had two kids, aren't exactly rich, and the child isn't even blood related.

"Well, this just got interesting.","I'm supposed to have the Essure implant procedure on Friday. I have the day off for my pre op tomorrow and the day of the procedure itself. Pretty cool that it's on my payday, which I have direct deposit for so this is going to be the most memorable payday ever, right?

Well, I woke up a few times last night freaking out. Totally forgot that nickel was one of the material samples in a skin allergy test panel I had done about 5 years ago through a dermatologist. So I called them the moment their office opened today... because I couldn't remember a thing from the results. 

Yep. Bullet dodged. ""You just had a mild reaction though...""

I can't allow myself to have the Essure implant. A fragment of nickel taped to my back for a few days is nothing. But an implant is forever. I called the clinic I got approved through and I'm waiting to hear back from them.

I sure hope I can still get SOMETHING done on Friday, just different tools on the surgeon's cart! I'm so close to my victory. SO. CLOSE! This clinic either removes the entire tube or clamps it.

Scheduled for Bilateral Salpingectomy in August (28F)!,"My SO (32M) and I have known that we are CF since we have been together and today I went in for a consultation to discuss my options for sterilization.  

I was primed for a struggle of wills with the doctor, but she walked in, informed me of my options for sterilization (including a vasectomy for him, tubal ligation or bilateral salpingectomy, or Essure for me) and then asked my opinion on the options.  I went with the B.S. because it was the surest form of permanent birth control.  

This could not have gone any smoother and I am so excited to finally have this concern off our radar.  

Here's the details of how it should go:  
-Surgery scheduled a short time after last period:  takes approximately 45 minutes for the procedure.  General anesthesia, catheter, laparoscopic w/ 3 incisions (belly button and left and right of abdomen), vaginal penetration for maneuvering of the uterus.
-Recovery takes approximately 3 hours w/ access to pain killers in the hospital.  
-Approximately 3 day home recovery with light work/moving and wean off pain killers.  
-Surgery post-op check in a few weeks
-Completely childfree w/o any need to go back for a fertility check

I'll update with how it goes and the insurance data as I get it too.  

Update (25JUL2016):  The Dr. office called today with a quote for the bill for the procedure.  The office quoted me $815.34.  When I called my insurance company with the procedure codes for the laparoscopy and the bilateral salpingectomy, they quoted that the procedure would be covered at 100% since it is considered preventative contraception.  So...after a call back to the Dr.'s office, they are going to investigate where the disconnect is and if they can't resolve the issue, I will still continue with my schedule, but I will be dealing with insurance issues along the way.

Anyway last week was my 3 month check up (yay) to make sure I was sterile.  First of all this was awful.  Evidently my lady parts are small which made it tough.  While laying there trying not to think of the pain I had a nurse trying to get me to talk about something.

First thing she asks is""How many kids do you have?"" 

Of course my answer was none I'm a dog person.  She then went on to ask some questions about my dogs which I love to talk about.  At the time were getting ready to adopt a new dog so I told her all about the adoption process we had been through and how excited we were. 

By this point the doctor was done(essure worked by the way) and came around to talk to me.  She had this look of pure joy on her face and said to me"" Awwww you're adopting!  That's so good to hear.  Boy or girl?"" 

My response""My dog?  girl."" 

Her, ""oh""

It's double silly because this is the SAME doctor that sterilized me in the first place!  

Geeze people

Bilateral Salpingectomy Recovery,"Throwaway acct because personal health info to follow.

I wanted to share my experience a bilateral salpingectomy, as I found posts about the process and recovery to be super helpful prior to my own procedure.

**Background**

At the time of surgery, I was 29 (November 2018). I have never been pregnant and have always known that I do not want biological children. I've been on birth control since I was 18, using various methods (pill, ring, shot). Most recently, I had a Mirena IUD, and as it was expiring I knew I needed to figure out something else. I didn't want to be on hormones anymore, even the low dose through Mirena. 

**Requesting Sterilization**

I had never mentioned sterilization to my doctor before, but I knew she was open-minded because she had agreed to the IUD back when the FDA only recommended them for women who'd had a child. I brought it up at my annual appointment in May, and she was overall pretty cool about it. I expected some of the questions to follow (""What if you change your mind?""  ""What if you and your partner break up, and you start dating someone who wants kids?""), but I came prepared with my answers based on research. Within about 10 minutes, she agreed to the procedure and walked me through options (essure, tubal ligation, and salpingectomy). She recommended the laparoscopic bilateral salpingectomy because of the bonus reduced risk of ovarian cancer. She told me that I am only the 2nd woman without children to ever ask her about sterilization!

**Pre-Op** 

I waited a few months before scheduling the surgery because of the physical restrictions during recovery. I didn't want to spend my summer unable to do things I love (running, hiking). She told me to plan on taking up to 2 weeks off to recover. I scheduled surgery to take place over Thanksgiving so that people at work wouldn't question my absence. At the pre-op, she walked me through the procedure... nothing too interesting.

**Surgery Day**

I was most nervous about general anesthesia and intubation. Fortunately, I didn't need to be fully intubated! No sore throat for me. The surgery was fairly quick -- less than an hour before I was in the recovery room. I had an incision in my belly button, a 5 ml incision on one hip, and a 7 ml incision on the other hip. All were closed with stitches and glue. The bruising was pretty gruesome on day one. I also had a fair amount of swelling in my lower abdomen, but it was less than I expected. I looked bloated, but only I could really tell. I was nervous to get dressed, because I didn't know how much I could bend/move my torso. They gave me a prescription for percocet and told me to take advil to help with swelling.

**Short-Term** **Recovery**

I only took percocet the first night before bed. I wasn't in too much pain, but I was worried that I'd wake up in pain and regret not taking something stronger than advil. I never needed the percocet again after that dose.

The day after the surgery, I walked a slow 5k at an incline on the treadmill. The day after that I walked 5 miles outside at the county park. I was able to walk at a leisurely pace without much pain. 

Sleeping was difficult because I had some phrenic nerve pain in my shoulder/upper chest. Every time I'd sigh or take a deep breath or yawn, it felt extremely tight. That was from the gas they used to expand my abdomen, and the pain lasted for about a week. Nothing really helped it, other than staying active and trying to take very shallow breaths.

I returned to work on Monday (day 5 post-op) without needing any restrictions. I was able to wear jeans without discomfort within about a week. The surgical glue came off on it's own after about 2 weeks, and the stitches dissolved on their own.  I slowly returned to light weight lifting after 10 days, and to cardio and heavier weights after my 4 week post-op appointment. 

**Long-Term Recovery**

I'm now almost 6 months out. You cannot see the incision in my belly button at all. The hip incisions seem to fade by the month, but they're still fairly obvious. No pain or restrictions!

**Insurance Coverage**

I'm a government employee, so I have really good co-pay insurance. The surgery took place in a hospital, so I had to pay that co-pay ($75). Other than that, there was no cost to me. I did have a small issue prior to the surgery because my insurance company wouldn't confirm whether the salpingectomy would be covered as birth control because it isn't an FDA approved birth control method. After lots of checking CPT codes and calls back and forth with the doctor's office, I was assured that they were going to use the right codes to get it covered. Bonus: The hospital reconciled their records and found that they shouldn't have charged the co-pay, so they're actually refunding the $75 that I paid.

**Other People**

My family has known I don't plan to have kids for years, so they've all been very supportive and accepting. My fiance's sister knows, but his parents don't. Everyone who knows about the surgery has been really cool about it.

NYS Sterilization Question :),"Hey everyone! I'm kind of new to this sub (not to reddit- just a new account), so I apologize if this has ever been asked before. I'm a female in my early twenties, and my entire life, I have been 300% sure that I do not want children. I'm not interested in ever having children, nor do I really even like children much, hence my wandering over to /r/childfree. 

Despite being on birth control for more than three years, and taking it RELIGIOUSLY each day, I've, unfortunately, wound up pregnant a couple times. As I said, I do not want children, so this has been a seriously rocky rollercoaster for me. 

I've come to determine that birth control pills are just not going to cut it anymore. I've looked into getting an IUD implanted, as well as a few other options. At this point, a tubal ligation truly seems like the best option to me. I was wondering if anyone on this sub could provide me with any information about the sterilization laws in New York. I've been told (by family members) that you have to wait until the age of 30, or you have to have two kids before they can preform one. I haven't been able to find much information online about it and was hoping maybe some of you would be able to help. :)

Thanks so much!

Update: So I've looked around in my area and found an all female practice that lists Essure and laparoscopic tubal ligation as some of the procedures offered. I'm planning on calling tomorrow to schedule my first appointment with them! If I like the doctor and staff, I'm planning to ask about permanent/long-term options and (hopefully!) make some plans for the procedure. Otherwise, I'll keep looking for another gynecologist until I find one I love and can deal with for a while. :) Thanks so much to the few of you who answered me and clarified some things for me.

do I just need another kind of doctor? Any ideas?,"I've had it with ob/gyns. I'm tired of their incompetence



For example: after agreeing with my observation that high progesterone or only progesterone pills/methods are worse for me, based on medical history and being switched brands/methods an average of every seven months, the latest doctor prescribed me a high progesterone pill and ran out so ""he'd have time for other patients""



Another ob/gyn put me on a new pill that he said was exactly like a pill I'd taken previously and which had the same side effects as all the others...and surprise surprise this one was just as bad. 


Another one laughed at my concern for bleeding for 8 months (by the time I saw her) and just kept repeating ""we'll check your bloodwork"" even though my general doctor *JUST* did that and my iron levels were fine (thanks to super healthy eating especially tons of tomatoes and veggies). She said in a really bitchy way ""If you *reeeeaaaaallly* want to, we'll check your bloodwork every week..."" 



Another told me in a really bitchy way ""that's not for you"" when she saw me looking at the essure brochure in her office. 


I'm sick and tired of this crap. Those are only a few gems here. 
But my issue is not only childfree and wanting a permanent solution for that:



But I have hormone issues that cause severe PMDD with a multitude of physical, emotional, and mental issues during that time, that has caused a pretty big negative impact on my life. When I tried birth control pills and the shot, the PMDD lessened a bit in severity but the symptoms became continuous and bleeding was constant on every goddamn pill. 


I did manage an appointment for an Essure consultation quite easily (even though I'm only 22) with my local planned parenthood that has an MD that's an expert there. But I'm really doubting that will do much help except give me the permanent birth control. I'd still have the PMDD and be suffering, but it wouldn't be every single day of the month (just roughly nearly half the month instead). 

Based on the patterns plus what the original ob/gyn said--of course he refused to fucking treat me because ""all womyns wants bay-beeeees!!!!""--and tons of research (real research like journal articles, etc. not webmd) my best bet would be ovary removal with possible replacement hormones for estrogen and testosterone (not progesterone). 




I can't afford to doctor shop anymore--time or money. I also don't have the time off work for ovary removal surgery yet, but at least I can try actual temporary solutions and get the process going for when I possibly can get the time off. 



Help? Ideas? Thanks?


I'm at the end of my limit. I'm pissed off and in pain and I'm tired of these assholes. I'd rip all that crap out myself if I could.

Any ideas? I've had it with ob/gyns. I'm tired of their incompetence



For example: after agreeing with my observation that high progesterone or only progesterone pills/methods are worse for me, based on medical history and being switched brands/methods an average of every seven months, the latest doctor prescribed me a high progesterone pill and ran out so ""he'd have time for other patients""



Another ob/gyn put me on a new pill that he said was exactly like a pill I'd taken previously and which had the same side effects as all the others...and surprise surprise this one was just as bad. 


Another one laughed at my concern for bleeding for 8 months (by the time I saw her) and just kept repeating ""we'll check your bloodwork"" even though my general doctor *JUST* did that and my iron levels were fine (thanks to super healthy eating especially tons of tomatoes and veggies). She said in a really bitchy way ""If you *reeeeaaaaallly* want to, we'll check your bloodwork every week..."" 



Another told me in a really bitchy way ""that's not for you"" when she saw me looking at the essure brochure in her office. 


I'm sick and tired of this crap. Those are only a few gems here. 
But my issue is not only childfree and wanting a permanent solution for that:



But I have hormone issues that cause severe PMDD with a multitude of physical, emotional, and mental issues during that time, that has caused a pretty big negative impact on my life. When I tried birth control pills and the shot, the PMDD lessened a bit in severity but the symptoms became continuous and bleeding was constant on every goddamn pill. 


I did manage an appointment for an Essure consultation quite easily (even though I'm only 22) with my local planned parenthood that has an MD that's an expert there. But I'm really doubting that will do much help except give me the permanent birth control. I'd still have the PMDD and be suffering, but it wouldn't be every single day of the month (just roughly nearly half the month instead).

Something like that had 10g of fat to promote gallbladder function. That part...within ten mins I was in so much pain. It def. brought back all the symptoms I had going on for months now. My question is I have a endoscopy on Weds and the results could come in tomorrow, but Im not sure. Should I still go if my results are showing that it's my gallbladder? Should I call and maybe reschedule if I can? My GI office is not so good with calling back in a timely manner and this seems like a time crunch.  Is it normal to feel that much pain for a HIDA?

Appointment set to talk about sterilization,"I had an appointment today to have my doctor check my IUD. I've had it for 3 months now and I still get intense cramping daily. The only days it isn't as bad is when I am mostly sedentary, which isn't an option most days. When I got it put in I was told it was kind of my last option since I have had cramping issues with all other birth controls. 

The person I saw was not my regular doctor, but they wanted to get me in and make sure it was still in place. All was fine and we talked about the other birth control methods that I have used. She mentioned that they did Essure in the office and gave me a brochure about it. I told her I was okay with permanent birth control because I have no desire to have children. 

I have an appointment set with my regular doctor to talk about Essure, but I am not sold on that for sterilization. Honestly the bad publicity recently has made me nervous about it as an option. I was hoping to just do a more traditional tubal. I unexpectedly got nerves about it all once the appointment was set. I know I don't want children, and that will not change.

IUD over Essure or Tubal,"I have no desire whatsoever to have any children.  I have a Mirena IUD and I am totally happy with it.  The best part - apart from not getting preggers - is that I also don't have my period.  It is such a bonus!

So my question is why do you ladies choose tubal or Essure over a Mirena?  I know some people think it is unhealthy to not ovulate, but I'm not a believer of that either (I maybe wrong).  I get that some people might not be able to handle the progesterone, but if you can tolerate it why would you want to bleed every month?  Am I missing something?  

I know I could also post this in /birthcontrol, but that is more about controlling birth rather than permanently preventing it.

Thanks for any responses!  :)

"The wedding is 7 months out, and the fiance said something that has me concerned. ","As mentioned, I am getting married in March of next year.

Background information: I am 22(f) and my fiance is 26 (m). We've been engaged for two years. I am vehemently CF, and initially he wanted kids. After a serious talk, he confessed to me that he did not want any (this talk was prior to the engagement) either, and we've moved forth from there.  

(I made sure to have that talk pre-engagement, because I do not want to marry someone who wants kids, as it is unfair for the both of us.)

This past weekend, he was on the phone talking to a girl that he used to work with.

It is clear she asked him when the wedding was, as he replied ""this coming March.""

The following question, I assume, was about kids. His reply ""Well, never say never, but the plan so far is ""no"". We'd like to travel and such.""

This made me perk my ears up. Never say never? But I thought we did say never. We've discussed vasectomies (which he sounds in support of, but we've not moved in that direction) and tubal ligations/the essure procedure (which he sounds uneasy about, because he thinks it would be easier just to do a vasectomy.)

Am I freaking out for nothing?

I just feel like the plan is a definite ""NO"", and it isn't a ""so far"" plan either, it's a ""forever"" plan. 

Perhaps he was trying to be diplomatic and not offend anyone. That's a possibility. I have brought this up to him before because he says things like this from time to time, and I am unsure about bringing it up to him for fear of continuing to beat a dead horse. 

Thanks for reading my wall of text. I needed to vent. 

EDIT: I am formulating my plan of attack in order to communicate my seriousness without making it a super big deal, as I could have simply misunderstood.

Tubal Litigation input....,"Hello all! I am a 32 year old mother of 4 who is definitely done having babies! I am currently on Ortho Tri Cyclen Lo with the understanding between my OBGYN and I that when I turn 35 I need to be off the pill for optimal health risk reduction. I have pretty severe PMDD as well as Borderline Personality Disorder, so mood swing control is absolutely critical and my highest priority. It's beyond life altering. I've never had cramps of real significance and my flow is light to normal but the moods.....😔
(Under no circumstances in this dimension or any other am I interested in any of the medical device options (Paragard, Mirena, Essure etc.). I already experianced a living nightmare behind Paragard and I doubt I need to say anything about Essure. I have ZERO trust in the medical device industry.....So obviously permanent is my only other option.)

Hello all! I am a 32 year old mother of 4 who is definitely done having babies! I am currently on Ortho Tri Cyclen Lo with the understanding between my OBGYN and I that when I turn 35 I need to be off the pill for optimal health risk reduction. I have pretty severe PMDD as well as Borderline Personality Disorder, so mood swing control is absolutely critical and my highest priority. It's beyond life altering. I've never had cramps of real significance and my flow is light to normal but the moods.....😔
(Under no circumstances in this dimension or any other am I interested in any of the medical device options (Paragard, Mirena, Essure etc.). I already experianced a living nightmare behind Paragard and I doubt I need to say anything about Essure. I have ZERO trust in the medical device industry.....So obviously permanent is my only other option.)

22/f and beginning to strongly consider sterilization,"I've been on the pill and Nuvaring. Both giving me varying and negative side effects. I had a guy friend tell me to ""keep trying"", as if putting my body through a 3 month minimum course of hormonal imbalance resulting in mood swings and no libido is like trying new shampoo. I've been strongly considering Paragard, but it's notorious for causing longer periods, heavier periods, severe cramping, and spotting. Not to mention the severe ones like it tearing into the cervix/uterine wall. I've heard countless stories from women who say the negative side effects are outweighed by having a longer term, no hassle, non-hormonal, effective form a birth control, and I believe it, but I have bad cramping as it is, and anything worse would have me bedridden.

I'm still considering it, and plan on discussing it with my doctor when I go in for a physical soon, but I'm now starting to think seriously about Essure. I have no interest in having children and frankly I don't want to change my mind. I want to stop myself from making that bad hormonally induced decision later in life. The way I see it is if I'm really that desperate to have kids years from now, I can adopt. That way I'm not abusing my body and can give a less fortunate child a home. The only real argument I can come up with to not do it is I have a pretty clean genetic history. Only one case of cancer which was my great grandmother but she was 80+ when it happened. Maybe 2 cases of diabetes but only obesity induced. My father, my sister, and I all have histories of depression, but only very mild. For all intents and purposes, I would likely bear a very healthy child, but what kind of argument is that?

I went to my doctor a few months back to have a hemorrhoid removed but he told me to wait until after kids because it'll be way worse then(way to add to my enthusiasm on the subject). Before that he asked me if I planned on having kids and I told him no. He said that could change, but he said it in a very factual, not condescending manner. I think he would be more open to the idea than a lot of other doctors, but I know the subject wouldn't be covered without a fight.

So the reason I come here is when I go in for my physical and discuss a means of birth control, should I strongly consider/discuss Essure with my doctor, or just take the **somewhat**(I've been discouraged by others from Paragard in the past due to the possible complications) easier road and discuss getting the IUD?",childfree,2013-11-13 02:11:35,pill nuvaring giving varying negative side effect guy friend tell keep trying putting body month minimum course hormonal imbalance resulting mood swing libido like trying new shampoo strongly considering paragard notorious causing longer period heavier period severe cramping spotting mention severe one like tearing wall heard countless story woman say negative side effect outweighed longer term hassle effective form birth control believe bad cramping anything worse bedridden still considering plan discussing doctor physical soon starting think seriously interest child frankly want change mind want stop making bad hormonally induced decision later life way see really desperate kid year adopt way abusing body give less fortunate child home real argument come pretty clean genetic history one case cancer great grandmother happened maybe case diabetes obesity induced father sister history depression mild intent purpose likely bear healthy child kind argument went doctor month back hemorrhoid removed told wait kid way worse way add enthusiasm subject asked planned kid told said change said factual condescending manner think open idea lot doctor know subject covered without fight reason come physical discus mean birth control strongly doctor take somewhat discouraged others paragard past due possible complication easier road discus iud,beginning strongly consider sterilization,"22/f and beginning to strongly consider sterilization I've been on the pill and Nuvaring.

Response to my doctor’s bingo that helped me get sterilized,"New to the posting on reddit thing (been lurking for a while) so I hope I’m doing this right. I can be a little longwinded so I put a TLDR at the bottom for those who don’t want to read my whole novel :)

I managed to find a doctor in a conservative part of the country and get sterilized this past December. What I said isn’t something I’ve run across personally in this subreddit (not saying it isn’t here somewhere) as advice for what to say to your doctor so I wanted to share in the hopes of helping other ladies out. 

I’d been asking at annual appointments since turning 18 and always got bingoed and noped by the doctor of the year. Last year I had two periods out of whack, VERY unusual for me, and decided to get checked out. I knew if I went in for this to any of the gynecologists I had been to previous years they would just say “oh you need to be on birth control to be regular” and not really look into what was going on deeper. Friend recommended a different doctor and I made an appontment. At the end of that evaluation/annual she asked about other questions I had, per my yearly routine I brought up sterilization. 

She immediately bingoed me (you’re single, what if you meet Mr. Perfect in a few years and he won’t marry you unless you have kids?), to which I laughed hysterically and said then he clearly isn’t my “Mr. Perfect”. 

I’ve been going through these discussions for ten years, so instead of being reserved and polite, after that comment I immediately launched into a mini-rant: “Listen, I am a 28 year old woman. If I came in here today and told you I wanted to have a baby I KNOW you would have no problem helping me with that. I have been asking for sterilization for ten years because I do not ever want to be pregnant ever, why don’t you help me with that? If the other doctors at this clinic have been doing their jobs properly you should be able to look at my chart notes from previous visits to verify this.” 

She didn’t have any words after that, and I could tell I had hit some sort of thinking bone, so I took her silence as an opportunity to share more. I told her I have the discussion with potential partners about kids on or before a first date, and that the fact I was single was a positive and meant I was obviously making this decision about my own body myself, not under coercion...and briefly told her my BC history: can’t even remember to take my other medications daily let alone at the same time=pill not an option, been on depo and it sucked, nuva ring sucked, hormones-even low/localized dose-make me bat shit crazy so no arm implant or plastic IUD, allergic to nickel so copper IUD and Essure not an option, would have gladly gotten Adiana (silicone version of Essure) but no doctor would sterilize me before the supply ran out (since the essure assholes sued them for patent infringement they had to stop producing them because of said lawsuit). Told her Adiana was what I really wanted, because of my fear of anesthesia, but I was finally accepting no clinic in the country had any supply left at this point, and a surgery with anesthesia was going to be my only option unless/until something new came around. 

She took more thinking silence, then said she wasn’t comfortable saying yes, first time she’d ever seen me, if I wanted to come back in a month or two we could talk about it more. Left the appointment, booked a followup with low expectations, this is conservative land after all, and came back in several weeks. I was ready to come in swinging and have to defend my decision more, even refused to pay my copay at check in, told them I’d pay it on my way out if the appt went well.

Nurse called me back, doing vitals and all that she asked when I wanted to have surgery done. We started talking about dates, I was shocked but still skeptical this was actually happening considering 10 years of personal experience. Then the doctor came in, smiled and said “you came back!” She immediately launched into discussion about my choices for the actual procedure, all the in and outs of the surgery prep and day, and confirmed the date I picked with the nurse. Not one bingo! She did cover as part of the consent form I had to sign that I knew these were irreversible procedures, the BS which I had chosen especially so. 

I asked her at the end if she had looked at my chart from previous years and she said “Nope. You clearly know kids aren’t for you, and were very well educated on all your options. And you are right, it is ultimately your choice to make, not mine, or anyone else’s.”

FINALLY.,"FINALLY got a referral for a tubal. It's taken three different doctors and five years, but this week I finally had some luck.

I went to Family Planning Victoria in Box Hill (that's in Melbourne, Australia. I'm fairly sure the other Australian states have something similar.). I was going for two reasons, one to get a referral, and secondly to get my birth control dealt with so the whole thing wouldn't be a complete waste of time if I got told no (got the Implanon). 

I opened with the birth control question, then moved on to asking for an Essure. This surprised the doctor as apparently Essure isn't all that common in Australia. But it did indicate to her that I'd done my homework (and I had, thoroughly). 

The doctor was awesome. No bingoes. We'd already discussed other forms of birth control when I was asking about the Implanon, so there wasn't the usual bullshit of trying to persuade me to try every other form of birth control ever instead of sterilization which I'd got from all the other GPs I'd seen.

She said I made a good case and referred me to Monash. She wasn't able to address how much it would cost, as apparently they don't see many cases of women asking to be sterilized and the billing is dealt with at the hospital, so that's an unknown at this point. I may be able to get it covered by the public system, but that will be for a standard tubal, not Essure (which is fine, I told her I'd be OK with anything short of a hysterectomy). 

So, some pointers for anyone trying to get fixed:

* Do your homework. Make damn sure you know what you're talking about because they *are* going to ask you about why you want it, whether you're aware of the risks/permanancy and why you want sterilization over other forms of birth control. If you can't answer these questions you're already on the back foot. I think half the reason she was willing to refer me was that I knew what I was talking about.

* Be prepared to make your case. And unfortunately, I don't think 'because I don't like kids and don't want any' is going to cut it with most doctors. In my case, mental illness runs rampant in my family and I wouldn't risk passing it on even if I liked kids (I don't like kids, but I didn't mention it). 

* Even if you get a referral, it's still up to the specialist whether it gets done or not. The awesome doctor told me as she was preparing the referral that I may still be turned down because of my age (32). So be ready to make your case all over again. 

* Try Family Planning or your state's equivalent if your GP tells you no. They deal specifically with reproductive issues and are much more likely to understand. I think they do vasectomy referrals as well. Here's the site for Victoria: http://www.fpv.org.au/

Holy wall of text, Batman! Still, hope that helps people, and if anyone has questions I'm happy to answer to the best of my ability.

I am so happy with Planned Parenthood in Minnesota. Added a doctor to list--no case necessary!,"Went to an Essure consultation with Planned Parenthood's MD. She did not once bring up my age, or question my choice to never have kids. I didn't even have to explain that I'd adopt if I did change my mind. But she kind of laughed when I said I hated dealing with babies stuff and said ""some women do.""


I told her that I really appreciated her not questioning my choice and discussing things purely from a medical perspective. She told me, ""well of course, that's my job! Some doctors just don't want to do theirs for some reason."" 


It turned out that Essure was not the best option for me, but she talked to me about it purely from a health/medical perspective. To give birth control AND severe PMDD treatment I got the copper IUD completely FREE plus possibly Nexplaonon *also* later if I need to for PMDD. Both are more effective than Essure by themselves so with both of them if I had a baby it would be a ""miracle""--still aborting miracle baby though. 


So if you live in Minnesota--especially the Twin Cities I completely recommend going here. If/when I have the money I'll make a donation. It was way better than the one in Memphis--not all of them even do Essure but the ones in Twin Cities do. 



I'm rambling now, but I'm so happy--even though the IUD insertion hurt like a bitch and I'm still crampy and in pain a couple hours later (but much less than before).

Considering permanent BC options. Anyone else have these fears about just losing the ability to have kids in general?,"Hoping this is the right place for this. If it's not just let me know.

So I've known since I was a teen that I wasn't interested in having my own kids. I would possibly be open to the idea of fostering older kids when I'm older but that's still a stretch. 

About two months ago I got really serious about looking into different BC options. I'm pretty set on the Essure procedure and there is a Gyno in my area that will do it once you turn 25. I was thinking about getting it for myself as a 25th birthday present. 

However, since then, I've been having these doubts. I know that I'm 100% bio kid free and it's not about not having kids. It's more like I'm afraid of losing a natural ability to do *something* regardless of what it is. Like I'm worried about altering this part of myself. I logically know that I will never use it but it still feels like I'm losing something.

Sterilization and insurance,"So to those who have been successfully sterilized and had it covered by your insurance- I need some help.

I'm looking at plans. If I cut out every single unnecessary expenditure and supplement my monthly payments from my savings I think I can pay for the most basic coverage for myself for one year. After that I will have exhausted my savings.

I'm having a really hard time understanding these policies. According to ACA, preventative services are supposed to be covered regardless of whether you've reached your deductible. But looking at plan details I'm not seeing this. It looks like they're saying you have to meet your deductible before ANYTHING is covered.

Also, how soon after you enroll does coverage begin for preventative?

"""Woman's Wellness Center"" ...oh really?","Pardon me, but I feel the need to rant a little, as I suppose we all do sometimes. 

We've moved states recently, and struggled somewhat to find a new doctor &amp; such under insurance coverage. My wife had been suffering immense hormone-related problems top-to-bottom with the implanon. She registers at this one covered place (see title) and this one cheerfully-friendly female doc of say late-40's to early-50's takes it out. She opts for the depo shot whilst we figure out what to do next i.e. something non-hormonal and *permanent*. She is also, really hating the depo shot's side-effects currently too.


""But wait-"" I hear you begin, ""-why don't you just get snipped?"" ~ I am thoroughly informed that even the low chance of chronic pain following the proceedure, is not good enough for her. We lead very active lives in that regard and so that's not acceptable, for either of us.


She makes an appointment with the same doctor again, to discuss either essure or tubal options. Might I add to this, we're both in our 30's. I stayed at home for this one; the lady seemed alright the first time and I didn't want to be seen as a possible source of pressure. 


Now, the good news? The option for surgery has been ok'd. She also managed to convince the wife to try the paraguard (somehow, last one she had I quote, was the most painful experience of her life) ""just to make sure non-hormonal is right for you"". Right, because she's never not-been on BC before or anything, duh. 


What really, hugely ticked me off? Good-job I wasn't there ticked me off? My wife had to spend *30-40 minutes* in there convincing the doctor, because right off the bat her opinion was ""no"". ""Well, I felt like that when I was your age, but three years later I had two kids, and couldn't be happier!"" - ""And with X option, you can always change your mind!"" ..... really? A female doctor, working in a role exclusively to support women's reproductive choices, and you're bingo-ing your patient!? 


I guess I'm venting about nothing much, because in the end the missus ""won"". I just really want to punch the person who's working at the closest thing we have to PP in the area who walks into an appointment about sterilisation with a middle-aged working professional automatically going ""no"" :| 


tl;dr- wife goes to woman's reproductive choice / support doctor, gets bingo'd, thankfully wins the day anyway.

[rant] When will I ever be 'old enough' to some of these doctors?,"tl;dr Dr. Foley and Somerset Gynocology will NOT perform permanent sterilization on anyone who is 25 because their 'doctors feel too uncomfortable performing any permanent procedure on someone so young."" 

I used Dr. Foley in Michigan per our child-free friendly doctor list. While the nurse was honestly pretty nice and said things like ""children is completely a women's choice"" she did have to check with all the doctors to see if any would do a tubal ligation. 
After about a week I got a voicemail from the office saying multiple times how 'because of my age none of the doctors feel comfortable performing the surgery, but they would be more than happy to help me with an IUD""

An IUD is NOT permanent enough and I'm honestly way to wary on how many women are lab rats to ESSURE because a lot of women have had to have hysterectomies after the procedure which you know, defeats the purpose of non surgical female sterilization and I don't think my insurance would provide that. Can't imagine a 26-30 yr old getting approved for a hysterectomy when it's such a pain in the ass to get sterilized because you know, potential babies are 10x more important than the woman with tokophobia who wants a fucking peace of mind about something that she needs Prozac for. 

I'm just so pissed off about this whole ordeal that it's making it hard to think straight so I'm sorry if grammar and other shit is off, it makes me fume that 16 and pregnant is fucking glorified and that you apparently are 'old enough' to bring another human being into your shitstorm life, but recognizing that you'd never want to be an incubator to a parasite at 25 is too young to know what the fuck I want. 

How at 25 am I expected to try to adult when I can't even be allowed to be an adult about my own fucking body?

We've come a long way as women, but this is fucking stupid that in a 'progressive' area in Michigan using childfree doctors and 25 is too fucking young? 

Moving forward, what should I do? I am limited with my insurance on the area, do NOT want essure and I WANT surgery. I need to go through a gyno because my PCP won't help. Should I go to these guys and become the most annoying patient about surgery or hope out of state or somewhere in Ann Arbor they would actually put the patient first and not their discrimination?

It's almost going to happen,"Hey! So, I've been lurking here for a while but about 2 years into my decision to be CF journey. 

I finally decided on Monday to email my OBGYN about the idea of tubal ligation, she said to make an appointment so we could discuss it. I did that, and came to the appointment ready to 'defend' my decision. Turns out, I didn't really have to (unless my reasons are good?). I told her my reasons. She went thru the mandatory birth control counseling and Health department (California) brochure on permanent sterilization. I went home and watched 5 videos (anaesthesia, patient safety, essure, laparoscopy, and tubal ligation). Saw her again today to sign the consent form. My video consultation with the surgeon is next Wednesday. My OBGYN suspects the surgeon may want to do the salpinectomy based on potential ovarian cancer in my family history. 

I also told my parents. My Mum was very accepting of this. My Dad less so. 

I am 32 and this is all thru Kaiser NorCal. I am so relieved that this is going well. I also will be keeping my Mirena for menses control. 

Anyway, thanks for letting me tell the start of my journey and I will keep you all updated! :) ",childfree,2017-12-14 23:07:42,hey lurking year decision cf journey finally decided monday email obgyn idea tubal ligation said appointment discus came appointment ready decision turn really unless reason good told reason went thru mandatory birth control counseling health department california brochure permanent sterilization went home watched video anaesthesia patient safety laparoscopy tubal ligation saw today sign consent form video consultation surgeon next wednesday obgyn suspect surgeon may want salpinectomy based potential ovarian cancer family history also told parent mum accepting dad less thru kaiser norcal relieved going well also keeping mirena menses control anyway thanks letting tell start journey keep updated,almost going happen,"It's almost going to happen Hey!

Sterilization Research Findings,"After reading a comment by /u/ImperfectJump ([thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/2talee/young_andor_childless_people_wanting_to_get/)) about how she prepared a binder for requesting sterilization at a young age, I decided I wanted to compile my own. Below are mostly the results of research of scholarly articles regarding tubal ligation, along with a cursory research for some anecdotal experiences. I think it would be awesome if everyone commented with further literature that they have, not just for women considering a tubal, but for anyone who wants to approach their doctor about sterilization. A lot of childfree have a problem getting their doctor to agree to sterilization, and I think this could potentially be a great resource from which to build a strong argument.

Below are mostly the results of research of scholarly articles regarding tubal ligation, along with a cursory research for some anecdotal experiences. I think it would be awesome if everyone commented with further literature that they have, not just for women considering a tubal, but for anyone who wants to approach their doctor about sterilization. A lot of childfree have a problem getting their doctor to agree to sterilization, and I think this could potentially be a great resource from which to build a strong argument.

Bilateral Salpingectomy Approved - UK Perspective,"Well friends, today it finally happened. After a 7 month battle, I attended my final appointment this morning and got the go ahead for my bilateral salpingectomy. Getting that wait list paperwork was such a relief, I walked out of the department with my fiance and promptly starting crying.

There's not a lot of posts regarding getting the procedure approved in the UK so I wanted to write up how things kinda played out for me. Hopefully it's helpful. Apologies if it gets really long. 

Background Info: I'm 28, nearly 29. I'm engaged and my fiance attended every single appointment with me. Previously a paramedic, have had years of experience raising siblings and looking after young family members. Been on hormonal contraception for 10 years, always been CF. Suffer from depression and anxiety. Extremely tokophobic, I do pregnancy tests every other week even though I'm on the pill and we use condoms. Located in NW England.

Reasons I want a bilateral salpingectomy:
1) I hate children
2) I have never been broody or wanted kids, nor can I relate or understand people who do.
3) I have seen kids die, I have seen the effects it has on the parents and I never want to experience that.
4) I have zero intention of ever being pregnant. It disgusts me. It makes me physically sick when I think of being pregnant. I wouldn't cope, the hormones would probably be catastrophic for me and I would definitely have post-partum depression.
5) I am too OCD and controlling
6) I would be a shit mom
7) I like sleep and travelling and having money
8) Fiance and I have a risk of passing along illness and disease, so just hell no. 
9) The world is shit, why would I bring a child into it?
10) I have nickel and copper allergies and also have a very tilted cervix/uterus so IUD's are basically not options. They also fail or migrate or fall out and it just wouldn't help my anxiety. Same applies for filshie clips. In fact, by the end of preparing all my arguments, I realised I just don't want foreign objects in my body (babies included haha).
11) For the sake of my anxiety, I needed the most permanent method, the method that could not be reversed.
12) Reduction of risk of cancer, helpful because of a lot of family history.
13) I have had to trade symptoms while on hormones. Combined pill gives me migraines, so went on mini pill. This stopped my period, which increased my pregnancy anxiety. It has also killed my libido and made my depression much worse. I tried to come off birth control and lasted two days because I couldn't cope with the chance of getting pregnant. I counteracted this by basically not being intimate with my partner. It goes on and on. Thankfully he is extremely supportive. 
14) My fiance is a marine engineer, I would be a single mum for 6 months of the year while he worked away.
15) I could go on forever but you get the gist.

In April I went to my GP and asked for a referral for sterilisation. This turned out to be the easiest part of the process, as he basically just shrugged and said sure when I said I was tired of being on hormones and I wanted a permanent method of contraception. I had loads of reasons ready to justify my request, but no explanation on my behalf was needed. That week I had a letter from the NHS prompting me to go online and book an appointment at 1 of 3 hospitals they had chosen. I chose my local hospital and chose the first available appointment, which was a month later and referred to as ""sterilisation clinic.""

I went through [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/5cq7ra/quest_for_the_cut_contents/) post multiple times and spent a week putting together my own version to take with me to all future appointments. This was invaluable and really helped me prepare for all questions and helped me gather my answers to common bingos. 

I attended my first appointment, which was with a nurse, and it was a complete waste of time. I was in there for ten minutes, all she asked me was if I had considered other forms of long term contraception, took my weight, told me my options would be flishie clips or essure. I told her I wanted a bilateral salpingectomy, she responded by telling me no because it was a major operation (incorrect). Then she asked my age. As soon as she realised I was under 30, she basically shut my file and said I needed to see a consultant as per protocol. Okay, fine.

I went back to reception to book my appointment with the consultant. First available appointment was 4 months away. I had a minor breakdown about that, but not much could be done about it. Every week my anxiety got worse, my libido continued to decrease and I was a just a general mess. 

When I went to my next appointment in August, I was met by a doctor who was not the consultant for the clinic I was attending. I immediately went on the defensive, because I had been waiting months for this feckin appointment to see the consultant and she wasn't even there. The doctor went through loads of things with me, everything from what sets off my anxiety to why I don't want kids to what procedure I wanted. She was really nice but she had no power to give me what I wanted. She told me I would still obviously need to see the consultant at clinic two weeks later. Ugh.

I attended the next appointment and finally came face to face with the consultant. The first thing she said to me was something about planned parenthood's recommendation about not sterilising anyone under 32, because a woman's fertility is still ripe. That pretty much set the tone for the appointment. It took me about 45 minutes of both myself and my fiance going through the dozen or so reasons I listed above before she finally agreed. She also asked why my fiance just didn't get a vasectomy, I nearly lost my shit. I am responsible for my own health and my own contraception thanks. Yeah we may be getting married, but who knows what happens to us in the future. Maybe he dies. Maybe his vasectomy fails. Again, my anxiety just wouldn't settle down if I was relying on someone else to prevent me from getting pregnant. She accepted this, reluctantly. She went through the consent form, explained the laparoscopic surgery, the wait list, the risks, etc. I signed it. She then tells me she wouldn't wait list me until she had discussed my case with another colleague. This colleague may also want to meet with me. She tells me I'd receive a letter within two weeks to notify me if I had been waitlisted or if I needed another appointment.

I waited three weeks. The letter came. I needed another appointment. My appointment was scheduled for five weeks later, so another two months total trying to get approved... even though I'd now signed a consent form.

This morning I went to the appointment. The consultant was amazing. There was no judgement, no bingo's. She went a bit deeper into my families medical history, congratulated me on my engagement, told me I was a competent adult making a well informed decision. I proved my homework and research had been done when she mentioned Essure and I pointed out that countries outside the USA are currently not allowed to perform the procedure. And just like, she whipped out the waitlist paperwork, confirmed I wanted both fallopian tubes out, and bam, it was finally done. The list is currently 10-12 weeks and I don't know how much notice I'll get in regards to a surgery date, but I can now look forward to a life where I don't have to stockpile pregnancy tests and the only children I'll have will be fluffy and in canine form.

tl;dr Live in the UK, got approved for a bilateral salpingectomy (on the NHS) after a 7 month process of jumping through hoops. Yay.

"Follow-Up post: I was going to get Essure done, remember me? My tubal ligation was yesterday and I couldn't be happier!","About a month back, I posted requesting experiences with Essure, a bit scared of the reality of it all. I got referred to a gynecologist who could perform the procedure, and took my lab history with me and just laid out the situation. With my blood clotting issues, the doctor agreed with my decision to be sterilized and we got the ball rolling on speaking with my hematologist to lay out what I needed to do to undergo the procedure.

Because I'm what you could call a bit special, I wasn't elligible to do the procedure in-office, instead having it done at a surgical center. In my pre-op visit with my surgeon, I explained that since we were already doing this at a surgical center and I'd already undergone the switch in my blood thinners to allow for general anesthesia/surgery, I wanted to re-hash the idea of just doing a traditional tubal rather than the Essure. My doctor agreed with me, so yesterday morning I showed up, signed all my paperwork, they knocked me out, and 2 hours later I woke up, tubes tied.

I slept most of yesterday, and they gave me plenty of painkillers. Today I sorta feel like I was in a fight and got punched in the torso, but no worse. I've injured myself worse working out. I've been instructed to take it easy the next week, and ease back into regular activity over the course of another week, and not to take any chances getting pregnant through my next menstrual cycle and badda-bing, badda-boom, sterile!
