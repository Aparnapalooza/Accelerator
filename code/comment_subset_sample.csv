My gyn told me that I am the first person that this has happened to under her care. Way to go me! I'm special :)  She said that it's a possibility and that they can reinsert it, but I have no intention of going through more pain to have it possibly fall out again. 

Husband has agreed to get snipped. That will solve our problem for now. I'm still on BC for regularity in my cycle so we'll have double protection. 

Unfortunately I still have cramping on the right side. (Which I'm pretty sure is the side that fell out). I was having cramping the week before it came out and every once and a while I'll feel a sharp pain or a dull cramp for a bit.

"First of all - as others have said, this doctor is not doing his job. If he's in a hospital setting or working as part of a practice that he doesn't own, please make a complaint.

http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/physician-resources/medical-ethics/code-medical-ethics/frequently-asked-questions.page

Second, even though that particular doc was jerk, there are plenty of docs who will perform tubals/Essure on CF women your age, particularly if you don't handle hormonal BC well. There's a small list of CF-friendly docs in the sidebar. Also, urban/university docs seem to be more CF-friendly in my (admittedly limited) experience, and Planned Parenthood is another good option.  When you make an appointment with a new doctor, it's totally fine to ask if any of the doctors at the practice are willing to perform sterilization procedures on women without children. It might save you some time, money and anger.

"(If in the US, sorry idk enough about health systems in other countries to give any good advice) The first step is to find an OBGYN who would be willing to perform the surgery. Check out the doctors list on the CF side bar. Make an appointment or call in advance to confirm they're willing. Either way you'll have to have at least one pre-op consultation. You shouldn't need a family doctor since OBGYNs are considered primary care doctors. If you have concerns about insurance, call your members services number (on the back of your card) and ask about OBGYNs in your area who are in-network.

Types of procedures available:

1. Bilateral salpingectomy: completely remove both tubes. Laparoscopic surgery; lowest rate of failure (no recorded viable pregnancies in history); added benefit of reducing rates of ovarian cancer (which can start in the tube). This is becoming the most favored option by doctors. Uterus remains meaning periods continue and pregnancy via IVF is possible.

2. Bilateral tubal ligation (""tubes tied""): cut/burn tubes to prevent egg from meeting sperm. Laparoscopic surgery; very low rate of failure, but viable pregnancies have happened (though more likely to have a tubal pregnancy); Uterus remains. This is also a very common choice.

3. Essure: metal coils inserted inside each tube to cause inflammation and scar tissue, blocking sperm from reaching eggs. Hysteroscopic (through the vagina/cervix/uterus); advantage of not opening up the abdomen (might be good for those with previous surgeries/scar tissue). Falling out of favor due to allergies to the metal used, will probably be difficult to find a doctor to do this. Uterus remains.

4. Hysterectomy: completely remove uterus (+/- cervix). Usually laparoscopic with the uterus ""delivered"" vaginally. This is considered MAJOR surgery and will be EXTREMELY difficult to get without another medical reason (fibroids, hemorrhage, certain cancers, etc.). The uterus is gone, meaning no more periods and IVF pregnancy is impossible.

"Got the Essure procedure done. Titanium coils so it removes the risk of allergies.

The one down side: I had to go in twice. My body's cycle is hectic at best so during the first attempt my doctor couldn't find my fallopian tube openings due to too much uterine lining. Second attempt went perfectly smooth.

I got it done in May. I was crampy and uncomfortable for about a week and had minor cramping for about a month. I've noticed no other differences whatsoever. And removing such a huge (yet previously unconsidered) source of anxiety once a month was great! Even when using other birth control there's always the ""but maybe..."" thought that you might be pregnant. Now that is completely gone!

As far as cost goes, I'm really not sure. I know my insurance paid over $10,000, but insurance costs aren't comparable since they pretty much make up their own ideas on what procedures should cost. Planned Parenthood has a pretty good system to help people who need help when it comes to finances.

Keep in mind, after 3 months you have to go in to get your fertility tested. While this part isn't as expensive as the procedure itself it can still come as a bit of a shock that there are further charges. Make sure you ask about that cost as well. 

Leading up to the consultation, I kept a piece of paper in my wallet and jotted down all my questions as I thought of them. It made it a lot easier when I went in for my consultation and I could just pull out the paper and start getting the answers I needed instead of stumbling over trying to remember things.

Why do you want your uterus out? If it's simply for pregnancy avoidance, that'll almost assuredly not happen.

Ontario

Belleville: Dr. Paul Kovacs OBGYN - Was more than willing to offer me a tubal litigation at age 25 when I informed him I don't want children ever. His bedside manner is pleasant but very to the point, he does not sugarcoat things he just tells it like it is and answers your questions. Had surgery done by him was very simple and easy no issues. There was a two month wait for an appointment. The office is busy but the most I ever waited was about an hour.


Brantford: Dr. Anne Powell OBGYN- Agreed to do a tubal ligation (Filshie clips) at age 27. Very easy to talk to and non-judgmental, listened to every word I said and took me seriously. 2 months wait time for consult scheduled December 11th, pre-op scheduled for February 8th, surgery scheduled for March 3rd.


Hamilton: Dr. Caroline Sibley OBGYN Essure procedure (hard to find docs who do this in ON) or tubal ligation, your choice. Also an overall great doctor. Very respectful during consultation, took my word for it that I was sure of my decision without prodding or condescension. Wait list for consult was several months long. However, from consult to surgery was 3 weeks.


Hamilton: Dr. Dustin Costescu - Performed tubal ligation with clips on 22-year-old woman. Called his assistant at McMaster to get a fax number, which I gave to my family doctor and asked for a referral. Was initially going to have to wait months for a consult but his office called the second an earlier appointment opened up. Surgery three months later. Not only did an excellent job with the surgery, but could not have been more respectful and honest during the consultation process. One of the best doctors I've had in any capacity. Very knowledgeable about birth control in general if you have questions or are considering other options.


North Bay: [Dr. Zeman] OBGYN - Provided tubal ligation at age 25. Waited 2 weeks for initial consultation, with basic interview and talk about the risks. Then waited 3 months for an available surgery date. Had it done lapriscopically thru my belly button, no scar at all! He is sometimes difficult to understand as he has a heavy accent and a little cold it seems at times, but he will listen to you, tell you your options, and then will ultimately decide with whatever you want to do.

GTA: Dr. Darren Sukerman -Family / G.P. Etobicoke, Ontario Trillium Health Centre - Queensway Site 416-621-9700

GTA: Canadian Men's Clinic - Dr. Blumenfeld &amp; Dr. Hirshberg - Provided a vasectomy to me at age 25 with no children. Absolutely no attempts to change my mind, absolutely no reluctance. A simple confirmation of ""This procedure is permanent, are you sure?"" is all I got. Extremely friendly &amp; non-judgemental. It is a men's sexual health clinic, mostly operating after hours and weekends. I had Dr. Blumenfeld, he is a kidney transplant surgeon by day, and operates this men's clinic by night. He is professional, skilled, and friendly. He told me that he has performed thousands of no-scalpel vasectomies. The procedure was quick, and mostly painless, and the doc was even making jokes throughout. I had a quick phone consultation, and the procedure was booked for 2 weeks after. This place should be your first choice if you are in Ontario. 416-636-7377 | http://www.mensclinic.com/

Toronto: Ontario Men's Health Clinic. I am a 23 years old male. The doctor had no problem referring me to the surgeon for a vasectomy procedure. He asked some pretty basic questions. I'll probably update the wiki once I meet with the actual surgeon (Toronto Vasectomy Clinics). I have a long term relationship (almost 4 years) with my girlfriend (who is also childfree). So far it took only 1 week to get an appointment for the referral (Men's Health Clinic) and 1 month for the consultation with the surgeon.

London: Dr. Michael Anthony Maruncic - Gynaecologist/OBGYN - Works out of Victoria Hospital. Took 7 months to get a referral appointment for consultation. He was informative and no nonsense. Didn't ask about my relationship status, just wanted to make sure I was sure and went over other options but was happy to do what I wanted in the end. Doing my tubal at age 25 in October, 3 months from consult appointment to surgery date.

London: Dr. Josef Vladars - MD - He is located on Adelaide St North (2016) and I believe he closed his FMD practice to exclusively perform vasectomies. My husband (at age 32) and another childfree couple we know both had their vasectomies there. The referral time between our FMD and seeing Dr. Vladars was a few months, then the first consult and the actual surgery were three weeks apart. The process was simple once referred (no huge hassle about not already having children), and my husband was in and out under an hour. A very professional and quick clinic.

Kitchener: Dr. Emma Wakim OBGYN. KARMA Clinic in Kitchener/Grand River Hospital. Referred by GP in January, consult in May. Surgery set for September, but got bumped twice to October and then November. Surgery was great! Tied my tubes using Filshie clips. I was 26 at the time of my consult, 27 when I had the surgery. Very no nonsense, listened to the short version of my argument, made sure I knew it was permanent, and then agreed to do the surgery.

Orillia: [Dr. Brock McKinney] OBGYN 705-558-2020 -- Tubal ligation, age 26. Five months from initial consult to surgery. Very nice, well informed, happy to do the procedure, but a bit paternalistic about removing tubes.

Oakville: Dr. Len DeBolster - So Simple Vasectomy Clinic - Great doctor, took 4 months from referral to consult, then another 3 from consult to vasectomy. Had no problems for childless couple, 29M and 26F.

Owen Sound: Dr. Paul Middlebrook. Asked my gp to refer me and she did - took about 2 months to get the consult after referral, vasectomy was less than a month later. Single 20M here. Doc was very professional and calm. Asserted firmly a few times that ""the procedure is permanent"", and trusted that I knew whether I wanted kids or not.

Ottawa/Cornwall: Dr. Bob Reddock. (Vasectomy) Won't see anyone without a referral, but if you do get one from any physician, he will see you. Very nice guy who is very understanding, and he told me, ""If you are old enough to serve your country, you can make your own life choices."" Less than a week from the time the referral was sent to when my consultation was. Very short waiting times. Here is his website.

Ottawa: Dr Wolfish. University of Ottawa Health Services. (https://med.uottawa.ca/obs-gyne/divisions/general-obstetrics-and-gynecology/staff-list/wolfish-karen) She's so fantastic! Surgery booked for a few months after my initial appointment! Not sure if you need a referral or not, but even if you do, totally worth the extra work!

Peterborough: Dr. Suzie Packenham, http://www.themedicalcentre.net/aboutus/physicians/pakenham.html

Sarnia: Dr. David Pressey OBGYN 519-332-2709

Sarnia: Dr. Martin, Urologist. Age 22, approved for vasectomy but wanted me to wait 3 months to see if I was sure about it. Day of procedure asked again and then went with the procedure. He said he doesn't normally do people this young though so have good reasons for wanting it done.

Sudbury: Dr. Bishwajit Bora, Urologist, Northern Urology Centre, 705-673-6836. Age 23, Approved for vasectomy and procedure was done on March 23, 2015. He was very polite and open minded. Didn't require any convincing, just a few questions before hand, then signed the paperwork! Be confident in your choice! If you are not 100% sure, from what he has said, he won't do the procedure. Don't show any uncertainty. Good Luck! :)

Toronto: Dr. Ally Murji, Mount Sinai Hospital and clinics at Women's College Hospital. (Essure) Was referred to Women's College Hospital by PPToronto. Be prepared to wait a few months before your appointment - they're very busy.

When I tried again at 26 I just had to fill out a load of papers and have a gyn+general health checkup. The wait time was rather long though, I had my papersigning and stuff in February 2016 but didn't actually get a surgery appointment until October 31st that year.


In my county (ÃstergÃ¶tland) Essure was the standard thing unless you had nickel allergy and they wouldn't let me have a salpingectomy straight away, which sucked. So because of that, I'll need to have extra surgery now and get it done since the implants have been giving me issues (can feel them all the time, it pulls weirdly and feels like I'm constantly ovulating+ one of them is too far down to be 100% reliable, and I can't have the Novsasure procedure done while I have them either) fun stuff!

"1.What birth control are you using? The arm implant and IUD and both very effective.

Use one of those (IUD or arm implant), a condom, and he finishes outside of you. There is absolutely no way to get pregnant if you use all three. 

2.Where are you? Can you travel? As there are places to get sterilized. PM me if you don't want to make it public. 

Can you afford to go home to get sterilized? 

Both Essure and a tubal ligation are out-patient procedures that could be done on a Friday and you travel home on Sunday. Totally doable.

"Neither a tubal ligation (tubes tied),  bilateral salpingectomy (tube removal), nor Essure (blocking your tubes) will impact your hormones / libido. 

What might go into this 'myth': Women usually stop hormonal birth control when they get their tubes tied. As in they return to their natural period. Hormonal birth stops your cycle so you neither ovulate nor have a period so when you are on it you have a lighter fake bleed. Or they might get it done after child birth which can impact things. Or they are on average older so premenopausal. Remember Correlation is NOT causation.

I had it done and no change (will post my experience after the evidence / links) It is a much simpler surgery than you think.

Maybe you saw the fake ""Post Tubal ligation Syndrome""? If so, the 'doctor' that created it, has lost her license for being batsh*t insane. See: http://www.casewatch.org/board/med/hufnagel/order_2004.shtml or http://caselaw.findlaw.com/ca-court-of-appeal/1230512.html

Some of the research disproving the fake syndrome - they didn't even find correlation, let alone causation:

Why? Because it can't /won't restrict the blood flow after surgery. This explains it quite well...

....    


My experience, if interested. Disregard below, if not interested.   


...   


I was late 20s, married, no kids and I wanted to find a more permanent birth control method. So I started researching what the procedure ""tying your tubes"" entailed / read a ton of experiences after my Paragard partially expelled at one year.   

I decided on a tubal ligation with Filshie clips. It has the best effective rate I could find (lifetime average effective rate of 99.75% see: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16259814 or http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/24560346/?i=1&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;from=filshie%20clips)

So I scheduled an appointment with my OBGYN, she is on the younger side and very openminded (there is a link in the sidebar to open minded doctors if you don't have a open minded OBGYN). We had a 30 minute conversation and she agreed that I was well researched / she was comfortable I understood it was permanent. After the consult, I discussed with her scheduling nurse when I would prefer to schedule it (it was around 3 months out). 

Cost: During my research, I triple checked the ACA law required the insurance to 100% cover it. I paid about $10 for the at home pain pills. So in *total* it cost me only $10.00! Check out www.coverher.org for info about that! 

Pre-Op:

Since it was scheduled 3 months after the consult the hospital required my doctor to do a Pre-Op with me. So week of procedure I had a Pre-Op apt with my Doctor. Basically just a quick check of everything. I asked whether I needed a catheter and she doubted I would. She gave no restrictions as to sex or exercise and just resume when comfortable. Got my pain prescriptions and pre-filled them so I could go straight home after my tubal ligation. Definitely ask to get them pre-filled. 

Procedure: 

It was scheduled for 8:00 am on Friday. Hospital told me to check in at 6-6:15 am for paperwork / prep. Paperwork was just double checking everything (copy of insurance card / etc). Walked to a private mini hospital room and Nurse started intake / asking health questions (when did I eat last, what medications/ etc) and changed into the hospital gown and signed my sterilization consent form. Doctor also stopped by to chat before. I told the anesthesiologist that I get nauseous under general anesthesia so they put a patch behind my ear to help. Then one of the nurses gave me an IV (they numb the area first). I peed right before so I wouldnât need a catheter (and I didnât). The nurse then put blue leg warmers on my legs to help prevent blood clots (this is normal for any procedure). Around 8:00 am the anesthesiologist came and gave me valium through the IV. Later I was then rolled into the OR. I don't even really remember leaving the room - they have some good drugs :)

Post-OP:
I woke up wide awake in the recovery area. The patch worked so I was not nauseous. The nurse asked my pain scale and I was at a 3/10. It was basically a bad period cramp type of feeling, but no real âpainâ per se. The doctor came back and told me everything was normal and that the actual procedure took 15 minutes. She made the first incision into my belly button (but because she was so awesome no scar there). The second small incision is below my bikini line. She then went to talk to my husband to give him the details and tell him after care instructions. 

After 30 minutes or so I was moved into the big recovery area. The nurse brought me food and juice. My husband came in and was really surprised how awake and normal I was. After 30 minutes of being in the big recovery area, I got dressed by myself and left. We left around 10:00 am. 

Tips: Wear loose fitting PJs and a thin maxi pad. Bring a bottle of water to drink after as your throat is sore. Have a pillow in the car for the seat belt. 

At-Home Recovery:

Friday: 
I went home and slept. I could walk around fine, I was just tired. I walked up the stairs to my bedroom by myself. My tummy was a tiny bit inflated by the gas they use to see what they are doing in there, but nothing crazy, it just looked like I had eaten a big meal / slight bloat. 
The pain pills made more tired so I just slept the rest of the day. I late lunch and dinner normally. 

Saturday and Sunday: 
The rest of the weekend, I just watched TV with my husband. I could do stuff, I just chose to relax. Basically it was just a lazy weekend. Have some good movies and shows to watch. I was sore, but just like too many sit-ups sore. I could have done errands if I needed to, but with the pain pills you aren't suppose to drive.

Monday:
I went back to work on Monday. No prescription pain pills and just did over the counter stuff Monday and Tuesday. No one even guessed anything :) The worst thing was really from the IV (big bruise as my veins hate IVs) but just wore long sleeve shirts for a few days. 

Tips: Heating pad for tummy and Popsicles for your throat. 

Summary: It was way simpler and easier than I thought! I have one tiny 1/2 inch scar below my bikini line that faded. The tubal ligation was the best thing I ever did! 

Edit to add: 

Oh and ask me anything you are curious about or I didn't touch on. 

And from the many posts in /r/Childfree , /r/sterilization, and in here that I have read, I think everyone agrees it has no impact on hormones, libido, long term period / bleeding, age when you go into menopause, etc.  It really is a myth from what everyone can tell.

"Studies have shown that hormonal birth control does not cause weight gain. Instead the hint of weight gain -even with a placebo - can cause weight gain. The mind is a powerful thing. If concerned weigh and log everything you eat. Portion control is a big issue - hence the weighing. So likely you just felt crappy and ate a little more than you realized - which we ALL do :) 

As to irregular bleeding and libido it may be because the device may be lower dose near the end of its life. You likely are still not ovulating - just less of a dose and irregular bleeding might occur.

You can add a pill ON TOP of the Nexplanon. Which means no user error with the pill since the Nexplanon would still be no user error (unlike the pill).

"1. I'm 26, had my tubal 3 weeks ago, after a failed Essure insertion. Hurt like a bitch for a few days, and one of my incisions got infected (my fault). Funny story, actually. I passed out at work and hit my head and got to spend the day in the ER all because of a tiny little incision. But it's fine now, and I'm almost completely recovered. (Pro tip: if you get a tubal, keep your incisions dry, *especially* the one in your bellybutton.)

2. I made a notebook detailing all the reasons I didn't want children, including research articles backing up my concerns. Told my gyno that I get really nervous around doctors and just handed her the notebook. Made sure I knew A LOT about the procedure, so she'd know I'd done my research.

"One of the consequences of the ACA was that sterilization is free through many (maybe even most?) employer-provided insurance plans now.  Even before that, many would cover a portion of the procedure.  That is why people are talking about needing to do it now.  Surgery such as tubal ligation can be prohibtively expensive without insurance coverage.  Vasectomies and Essure tend to be cheaper, but still costly without insurance.

Elective partial hysterectomies are fairly rare.  Unless there is a medical reason like endo (therefore making it non-elective) most doctors will not perform these.  The potential consequences on the body are more more severe for removing the uterus than severing the fallopian tubes.

If you are interested in sterilization you should call your insurance company (or consult the most recent edition of your policy).

"From the literature I've read the failure rate is pretty similar for a cut-and-burn vs clips (only the full removal has a lower failure rate). My main concern was that if a cut-and-burn fails, then I need to get an abortion and get it re-cut and burned. It would be traumatic but fixable. If a clip fails, then I've got this clip floating around in my body that may need surgical retrieval or may be irretrievable, and if it finds it's way near a nerve or a blood vessel, could cause increased complications and a higher risk of long term pain. Plus, anecdotally there's a lady on this forum who did actually have a clip fail and a subsequent pregnancy which did really worry me. And, again anecdotally, I have heard of perfectly placed clips causing pinching and pain due to their position and placement and I was worried about doing an elective procedure and ending up worse off. And then there's the hippie part of me that doesn't like artificial things in my body. I know if I'd have had clips I would have worried about them until menopause. I'd be doing a pregnancy test every time I felt a pinch! I think specialists like the clips because it has the best success rate for reversals.

"This is going to be long. 

My story started similar to yours. Always been childfree. Hated periods. Fast forward to earlier this year just past my 34th birthday. I go in for my pap and oh hooray its abnormal, AGAIN! I go in every 6 months and every other time its abnormal. No, what it is is FRUSTRATING. When I had my 2nd appt to see if they needed to cut anything out, it turns out the vinegar didn't turn any tissue white so no need for any tests. I almost spent hours there for no reason, except... Behind the scenes I had written- yes actually WRITTEN a rant to hand to my ARNP about how my reproductive system is ruining my life. Taking birth control back to back so no pregnancy or periods- cuz screw both of those (I made it CLEAR AS CRYSTAL with how childfree I am while remaining professional/polite about it)- then having taken BC for so long I developed melasma which is infuriating- the lengths I go to minimize it.... I spoke with my boss before my appt and she had given me the idea to ask for an ablation if they say no to a hysterectomy, cuz it was much simpler than doing surgery. The ARNP reads this and looks at me and says without anything being wrong with me and being so young that no way would blue cross pay for my surgery. I played the essure/ablation card next. She said if this is what I want she can set up an appt for the ultrasound and the sonohistogram (where they squirt water in your uterus and take measurements/pictures) and start that up. JOY! I go in for the scans and it turns out I have a blob of endometrium stuck to an ovary, one of my tubes is completely sealed shut, and I have like 8 fibroids. Long story short after talking with the actual doc during consult- I COULD still get the ablation, but with a HUGE ""but"": I had to be put under- because the one essure coil would have to be literally shoved into the tube due to the sealing, and, you can't do novasure with essure. Why? Cuz essure has to be implanted first and is metal, so you'll basically get scorched internally from the novasure reacting to it. You have to do the other ablation that is with intense COLD and you must be put to sleep for that. He said also that with my young age and fibroids that the ablation has a 30% chance to wear off in 5 to 7 years- at that point I'd have to get the ablation redone, or get a hysterectomy. The light at the end of the tunnel was when he said ""But since you actually have problems with your uterus paired with the abnormal paps we could very easily get a hysterectomy approved now."" Not only that, but unbeknownst to me this isn't ""your grandmothers hysterectomy"" anymore. He's done a ton of them on younger healthy women who go back to work in one week. ONE WEEK! He was trying to be all nice and ""You don't need to make this decision now..."" PFFFFT. No. I told him to get the team on it STAT. Miss Uterus is coming out with her BFF Cervix. Surgery day came. Did the laporoscopic surgery with removing/pulling the tissue out the vagina. 3 incisions were made- two of which I requested be done inside these shitty tattoos I have down there. Those and the belly button one are all less than 1cm wide and healed to be nearly invisible. I was only in the hospital for 13 hours. A couple hours after my surgery I was walking, peeing, eating... I went in at 7am and my friend picked me up at 8pm. I spent the week camped on my bed with my laptop and snacks. This was by choice. I wanted NOTHING to go wrong. No 'over doing it'. I got up several times a day and cooked and took care of my pets. Visitors came to bring me things and do some errands. On the 8th day, Monday, I went back to work at my desk job. It was mildly uncomfortable, like going to work on the first day of your period kind of way, but do-able. Its been 2 months since surgery day (June 3). So no uterus, no periods, no BCP's, no cervix, happy ovaries stayed and are happily pumping hormones, no scars... the last thing I am holding my breath for is the melasma to fade. 

PHEW! Sorry that was so long! But you seem like you needed to hear it. 

PS:  Btw- keep in mind, just because one Doc may say no, does not mean they all might. If you have access to, whatever, 20 gynos- I would visit ALL 20 of them until one said yes to what you want.

"&gt;it isn't permanent

Essure *is* premanent and is advertised as such. But yes, it's not in the sense that it's technically reverseable (so are vasectomies). But what *truly* adamently childfree individual would ever do that?! No one.

Of course, no birth control method is 100% effective. Howeve, according to the FDA, Essure ""is 99.83% effective *when used according to the approved instructions for use* based on five-year clinical study data"", according to the FDA. And I think that's pretty damn close.

And yes, it's true that those who have the Essure procedure are more likely to have an ectopic pregnancy if they get pregnant, essentially making it ""not permanent"" either. But I suspect those who have unfortunately gotten pregnant after Essure were impatient, stupid people who had unprotected sex BEFORE the three month waiting period (before they've had the Confirmation Test done), which is why they [Essure] say ""you *must* continue to use another form of birth control until you have your Essure Confirmation Test"". 

Also, the evidence against Essure appears to be merely anecdotal. Everything I've read about women getting pregnant after the procedure were those who already had multiple children: two, three, four, and even FIVE in one case. So, maybe the coils ""didn't take"" for them because they had already been pregnant before (and carried to term more than once), so their body overrode their now blocked fallopian tubes because it's so used to the drill.

Some tips to finding a doctor: 

1.Have you checked out the CF friendly doctor list (linked in our sidebar as well) ----&gt;

2.You need to do a ton of research and know what type you want. Studies, first hand accounts, videos, etc. Know **everything** about it! Search /r/sterilization as well as /r/Childfree 

3.Know the ethic opinions regarding Doctors' Conscientious Refusals: http://www.acog.org/Resources-And-Publications/Committee-Opinions/Committee-on-Ethics/The-Limits-of-Conscientious-Refusal-in-Reproductive-Medicine?IsMobileSet=true

4.Say ""I have thought about this for years,  done a lot of research, and decided that the best birth control option for me is Sterilization by X method. How many of X method have you done? ""How many of your patients had it fail?"" Etc.

5.When she asks the regret question like, ""have you thought what you would do if you partner suddenly wanted kids?"" Don't get emotional, just answer truthfully.

6.If she is unsure solely because of your age say, ""well, you just met me, what if I come back in 3 months and reaffirm my request?""

7.If she is rude or says no just say,""I know sterilization is best choice for me and I believe in body autonomy, so your personal opinions will not affect my care. Therefore, please refer me to another doctor by X date.

"Do it.  I had NO adverse effects and didn't have a period for 3 years!  I am VERY hormone-sensitive, so for me to say that is amazing.

The insertion was painful for about 10 seconds.  Enough to think ""oh [bleep]...this is going to suck..."" but I was able to breathe through the pain and then it was done.  No cramping at all for me.  At the time of installation, I was 27 (I think) and no previous children (obviously).

Mirena was my favorite form of hormonal birth control and the one with the fewest side effects.  I removed it on my own (easy and painless!) after about 3 years because I wanted to go off hormones completely.  I have had permanent sterilization (Essure) done since then.  If permanent sterilization were not an option, I would gladly have used Mirena again.

The waiting and fear are the worst parts.  There will be a moment of searing pain (I think as they go through your cervical os), but just take a deep slow breath and by the time you are done, it will be fading away.

"IAMA 22 year old female. Got approved for a tubal.

Try to find a teaching, non-religious hospital. Also, make up a number of pregnancies you've had and either aborted/miscarried. The dr. at the hospital I go to only asked me about how many times I've been pregnant(twice), why I don't want to be pregnant again, how many sexual partners I have(1), and that I understand it's permanent.

**DO LOTS OF RESEARCH.** 
Make sure to read your rights as a woman. Read the human rights of UN. Make sure you are persistent and stand your ground. Make sure you read all the risks. Make sure to tell them that you have a back-up plan in case you regret your decision(IVF/adoption) and make sure that you look up all the possible information you can possibly find.

My dr. recommended Essure for me but I don't want to wait around for 3+ months for the scar tissue to grow, and Essure obviously has no incisions, stitches, etc.

Also, I have a copper allergy, so I told them I don't feel comfortable with having that in my body.

Also, make sure to find a therapist, and express desire for a tubal at every other appointment, that hormones are making you have ill side effects, that you don't feel comfortable with the IUD slipping out, etc. 

Once you start looking around to have the tubal done, have your therapist write out a recommendation(make sure the therapist agrees **with** your decision) for the doctors you see. If the therapist doesn't agree, start expressing your desire with more intensity. 

One more thing, try to make yourself sound like a damsel in distress to the therapist and the drs- be dramatic, but not **too** dramatic.

I also slept from the time I got home yesterday through to this morning.  The procedure itself was very quick and my doctors were all very professional and funny.

"This reminds me of when I had my essure procedure done.   (I wish I could recommend it, but it has caused problems for many other women allergic to nickel). 

 I went back and forth on the phone between my doctor's office and my insurance many times, but it was like they weren't speaking the same language.   From what I could figure out it was either going to be 80% covered after my deductible (which would have ran me about $4000) or 100% covered before my deductible (costing me $0).  

I got the specific codes for each billing possibly from my insurance.  When I read them to the doctor's office, they said they only had one option on how to bill it. They had no idea what the insurance codes meant, so they couldn't tell me which way it was going to go!

In the end I decided that I still wanted it even if it cost me $4000.  I had the procedure not knowing how much it would cost me.  I am happy to say it ended up being covered 100%!

Good luck with everything. I will say this... after a few more years, my endo/adenomyosis (which they didn't find the first time) became horrible, and I ended up having to have a hysterectomy anyway.

"You're right that it will be an uphill battle to get a hysterectomy without a medical indication. If your main reason is for permanent birth control, would a bilateral salpingectomy, tubal ligation, or Essure suffice? All will prevent pregnancy to a very high degree, though won't stop periods. If amenorhhea is your goal, you could look into getting an ablation.

If you're in the US, and your insurance will cover the ablation, I would recommend getting it. There's basically two outcomes:

1) It works, the lining scars down and your periods are much lighter or completely gone. Yay! If this happened, they would recommend/require some kind of birth control still, and a salpingectomy would be easy to get (if that's what you want). Would you be satisfied with this?

2) It doesn't work, the lining grows back and you revert to your previous flow. Unfortunate, BUT here's where this can help: go back to the doctor, tell them it didn't work (that you failed ablation) and insurance is more likely to cover the next most invasive procedure: a hysterectomy. Now you have a ""medical reason"".

"Some things you might be missing:

* She's not asking for change in the procedure or product, she wants it banned. This is a *big* difference.

* The number of people reporting side-effects is not as significant as those  for other contraceptive options. Apparently it's 800 in 700,000 procedures officially, but the numbers can vary depending on your sources and what side-effects you include. Some extremist sites looking to get it banned have lists that look shocking but are actually self-reported and thus less reliable, and include things like headache, fatigue, nausea, and diarrhoea as side-effects and reasons for removal. 

* There are claims that this is simply a publicity stunt for her... which branch a little deeper if you care for bitchy gossip but I can't really be bothered. It also has implications for the people it affects - i.e. she doesn't care who her actions affect, it's all an act, she's just in it for her own image.

I don't like it and I'll tell you why.

She's a big name and she's being used as a figure head for a scare campaign to push women away from a procedure which has been accessed by hundreds of thousands of women without any problems. She is attempting to completely remove our right to access this procedure based on suspicious, supposedly self-reported data. We already have trouble getting access to sterilisation, the last thing we need is our options being limited further by a scare campaign and/or subsequent ban.

Now, I've never really been comfortable with Essure. I don't want sharp metal coils in my fleshy bits. I wanted Adiana, but they took out the competition.

"&gt;Why can't I get a routine hysterectomy? Granted, it is a more invasive procedure than a tubal ligation but that shouldn't matter.

It totally does and should matter! Most doctors don't want to do a much more invasive surgery, when a smaller one (or no surgery) will suffice. It's more expensive, it's more dangerous (anesthesia is *way dangerous*, it's why anesthesiologists make so much money). A tubal ligation or Essure or the like work just as well for permanently preventing pregnancy. Continuous birth control (as in, taking the pill continuously, and skipping the placebo week) can be used to skip periods in a lot of cases, and the hormonal IUD can often reduce or stop periods as well, so... yeah, you can bet a doctor is gonna try those unless there's an excellent reason you need that uterus gone. Having a normal period is not considered a medical problem. 

I honestly don't think this is a sexist thing. Surgeries are dangerous and expensive. When you're paying out of pocket (like for most elective cosmetic surgery) this doesn't matter so much, but when it's coming out of insurance or whatever... that makes life difficult for everyone. And if you die (which there is a greater than 0% chance of), their malpractice insurance is gonna go way up. So, you know... that.

"Yes, I am in the USA. I have Cigna through my employer. I just recently received my Explanation of Benefits (EOB) from the surgery and here is the breakdown:

Cost of Surgery: $27,700
Insurance Discount: $24,500
What my plan paid: $2000

My out of pocket expense would have been roughly $1,200, but since I have a Health Reimbursement account where my employer gives me money for meeting certain conditions (healthy weight, cholesterol, blood sugar levels, etc.) My HRA paid an additional $900; Leaving me with a final bill of $300. 

My plan is to pay what I owe, but it seems like from what I have read in this [link to the NWLC](http://www.nwlc.org/im-having-problems-insurance-coverage-essure-tubal-ligation-or-related-doctors-appointment) I should be covered under the ACA sterilization guidelines.  Therefore, I will be sending the insurance company a letter and trying to seek reimbursement. 

To keep things in perspective, if I didn't have the HRA and the procedure would have cost me (out of pocket) $1,200 that's equal to what my friend pays for two months of child care; when you look at it like that, it's quite a bargain.

"/u/RedheadCFforLife posted what was mostly my list too, but to add some other ideas/further perspective on the same line of reasoning:

a. I also leveraged the wiki list of doctors here and said wouldn't it be better for all of us if I were to get this done in my network and covered by insurance? If you won't do it I will go to a clinic, I will fly wherever I have to - it's happening. I'd like it to happen here, with you. Doctor agreed that if I was going to get it done in a back alley failing all other options (not that it would have come to that...but I do live close to Tijuana lol) it was better for all if it was done in my health care network.

b. I am lucky enough to have a supportive parent. I mentioned that my dad said he would vouch for this being a long term decision of mine, not rash or recent. She never actually followed through and called him so depending on your doctor you could bluff/find a friend with a phone willing to stand in, if you're that desperate to get it done.

c. /u/redheadCFforlife already said this, but i need to reiterate - RESEARCH! Why is hormonal BC not acceptable? Why not an IUD? Why not a copper IUD? Why not depo shots? Why not Mirena? Sklya? Why can't your partner get a vasectomy (my answer: He can, we want to cover all our bases!)? While I think ""Because I want permanent peace of mind."" is a 100% ok answer to all of those questions, being able to talk about the issues associated with all those forms of BC is more helpful with doctors. 

Also research tubals, ablations, and essure (if that's available for you). Do you have a preference? Why? Are you comfortable with the risks? If he tells you that he doesn't like to perform it because of the regret factor, it's nice to able to reply that ""Of women who previously had no children, the chance of regret was only 6.3% and I like those odds."" (My Dr. laughed when I said that)

d. re: the age issue. Others have mentioned: If you were looking for IVF/to get pregnant no one would bat an eye. That is significantly more life changing than NOT having kids! Not sure about the UK, in the US most doctors you have to sign something and wait 30 days before the procedure, or sign a waiver and you can have it done in 3. Offering to sign something and wait a set period might help. Personally, having to wait 6 months would drive me crazy - but it's better than not getting it done! But you might be able to negotiate for 3 months instead of 6, or even down to 30 days. I'm not sure - but worth trying/looking into what is usual for where you live.

e. If for any reason they bring your partner/potential future partners into it - ""what if your partner/spouse/you meet someone who wants kids?"" Just firmly tell them you don't date people who want kids. I had to tell my doctor a couple times that my SO is on the same page about me re: not having kids.

"**""Resigning from parenting until you get that shit fixed.""**

This terminology is wrong. You can't resign from something unless you started. That would be like saying I had kids, then 'resigned' from them. I never started having kids, and I never will. It's not an issue that needs to be fixed. In fact, I plan to fix that possibility permanently by getting tiny little plastic inserts called essure in my tubes to ever prevent that happening. I have no regard for people who act like children are the be all and end all of the world and we should disregard our planet and our future sustainability by having huge amounts of kids. Seriously, we're not going to go extinct if a few of us don't breed, but we just might if everyone else keeps breeding at this rate.

**""parents matter a lot more than teachers, sorry""**

While it is true that parents are the first educations of their children (And that can be both good and bad. Usually bad, actually.) and provide their kid's basic needs, until you can educate your child from birth to yr 12 (or wherever high-school cuts off where you live) and even university (lecturers are teachers too, or course) I would not be so fast to dismiss us. While I have nothing against homeschooling, very few parents have the resources and the knowledge in how to actually educate their children, where as we've actually decided to be trained in these areas. Without teachers and schools, children from low SES backgrounds would never be educate either. As far as progressing society goes, we are foundational in that. I personally believe in a very family centred practice, and that not only includes parents, but extended family that the child has emotional attachment to, and/or partake as caregivers to that child. Often these people have as much as (or even more) impact on that child's development and world views then their parents. You totally missed my point about bettering society through education and went to ""BAWWW PARENTS ARE BETTER"", a totally unrelated point.


**""tell your immature fucking mob that the people actually having children are absolutely no better or worse than they are.""**

I don't think anyone here claims to be better then anyone else. They simply enjoy a different lifestyle and this is their forum to talk about it, along with the shitty parenting we see and notice that reaffirms our views, or our life experiences and discussions that also do so. Complaining about this here is like complaining about feminist discussions over in the feminism subreddits, or whining about people talking about mens rights over in the men's right subreddit. You need to find a pro child subreddit to voice your views instead of whining here like a child where you are vastly outnumbered. What I mean by that is should you be able to act like an adult and hold a civil conversation I'm sure /r/childfree would be more then happy to chat and debate with you should you actually be serious, but your copious amounts of unnecessary swearing (use it like pepper to spice up a post, not as the entire body of your discussion, for christs sake) and insults along with absolutely no discussion basis beyond trying to offend in your posts just means you'll either get passive aggressive responses like this trying to provoke you into making (more) of an ass of yourself for our own cynical amusement. I'm awaiting the necessary ""LOLO I TROLL YOU"" post as I type.

Also, the irony in ""Immature fucking mob"". Fucking lol. The majority of the responses are well articulated and thought out here. Yours is not (see above). I wonder where that sits on this scale, then? Keeping that in mind, I made a response to your post in the same manner as you have been posting. If you're going to make that accusation, I may as well be the one to fulfil it.

"*Once again*, all I suggested he do is get a second opinion. If this was cancer, encouraging him to get a second opinion would be a perfectly logical piece of advice. 

As far as female sterilization...maybe ask the women who were maimed by Essure if sterilization is âlow riskâ? And maybe ask all of the low income/First Nations/disabled women who were sterilized against their will if it was the best thing for them? 

And no, female birth control is absolutely not low risk.

"Most sterilizations do not remove the ovaries, which control the hormones involved in cycling, so other than your own personal feelings of relief, lack of worry, etc., you're not going to see any changes in your mood or body. That is assuming that you were not on hormonal contraception prior to sterilization--there will obviously be changes in your body and mood and cycle if you stop taking that. 

That was the kicker for me--I can't really function without hormonal birth control and sterilization won't do anything about the main reason I take/took it--which was to make my life livable. Also, when it came down to it, I really was uncomfortable with removing my ability to make a choice about kids. I choose not to have kids, I don't want to ever say otherwise, you know?

I ended up with the Mirena IUD. I went to the doc to talk about sterilization and long term options and while she was happy to talk about permanent options for me, she did admit that her office required her to have her patients like me jump through some hoops before the procedure was approved.

"Holy shit, your post speaks to me on a deep level. 

Iâm currently 24 and was on birth control for the past ten years. Hereâs a quick summary of my experiences on birth control:

-the pill: my go-to and what I used for the majority of my ten years on birth control. It made me moody and caused me to have low libido. 

-Depo shot: I also bled for three months straight. I wasnât aware that you shouldnât take Depo if you have a history of depression.. I couldnât get out of bed for those three months. I dropped out of college because it got so bad. 

-Paragard: I had a terrible experience with it. I would say it contributes heavily to my current state of health. I had it in for 14 months and gained 80 fucking pounds on it. Nothing regarding my health or lifestyle had changed in those 14 months. My abdomen became bloated, chunks of hair started falling out of my scalp, and my health started declining. Not only was my physical health being compromised, but my mental health too. I finally had the IUD removed and when they took it out, 90% of the copper coils were missing! The 10% of remaining coils were rusted out. I was supposed to have that IUD in for 10 years, and it was almost destroyed after 14 months. It was terrifying. 

Anyway, I managed to lose the majority of the weight I gained while having the IUD. I went back on the pill and felt much better, but decided I donât want to take it everyday for the next 20-30 years. So, I decided to seek different sterilization options. 

I met with a doctor off the CF doctor database and explained to him that Iâve tried multiple forms of birth control, including my experience with the copper IUD. He told me he wouldnât want me to try Essure (coils they stick in your Fallopian tubes)  or Fishlie clips because of my bodyâs reaction to the copper IUD. Apparently my body doesnât react well to different metals. Anyways, he recommended the bilateral salp. to me as it completely removes the Fallopian tubes. No metal. No hormones. Easy recovery and super effective. 

I had the surgery done one month ago and feel amazing. Liberated. The birth control journey was exhausting and Iâm glad Iâll never have to worry about it again. 

Let me say this: youâre NOT crazy for your experience with the copper IUD. Generally, if I share my experience on Reddit, a lot of people get in my face saying Iâm wrong. They say âsomething elseâ must have caused the health issues, not the IUD. Iâm telling you, it was the beginning of a long road of health issues for me. Iâm glad it works for so many people but it definitely wasnât a positive experience for me. 

With all of that being said, I would definitely pursue sterilization. Educate yourself and keep in mind your birth control experiences! Good luck to you, OP.

"I didn't really have a defining moment in my CF journey. For me, it was just that: a journey. A very lengthy, winding road that eventually had an end, I just didn't know it at the time.

In my senior year of high school, we had a project where we had to write down our goals for the future. I remember rather vividly that one of the top goals I wrote down was ""possibly get married and have kids"". I think I wrote that because I was struggling to think of ten simple long-term goals to complete my assignment; I'm the type of person that can create goals till the end of time but I rarely act upon them, and when I do, I give up at the halfway point. So, I think I wrote that down near the top of the list specifically because I thought answer was probably expected of me, as I'm a woman. There was no real meaning behind those words, but whomever would've stumbled across them, would probably be satisfied by that answer.

For the past eight years, I've become very aware for something gnawing at me. Tokophobia.

"Sure thing! The options are clips, ties or salpingectomy.

Clips and ties are known as âtubal occlusionâ and itâs basically a way of blocking the Fallopian tube. There used to be an implant method called âEssureâ that was put inside the Fallopian tubes but you canât get that anymore as it caused horrific complications for some women.

Bilateral Salpingectomy removes the fallopian tube. It has a lower failure rate and it also reduces the risk of ovarian cancer. However, I understand itâs harder to reverse (basically non-reversible) whereas the clips could be taken off etc. 

Iâm opting for bi-salp because my mum has had pre-cancerous cells before so the lower cancer risk is a plus and because Iâd prefer not to have foreign bodies inside me.

"Background: My husband and I are both only children, so for both my parents and my in-laws, the only way they'd get to be grandparents is if we spawned.

My parents wanted grandchildren, but weren't in our faces about it, except for one incident.  My father assembled a stack of photos, mostly of him and/or his sister as children, with a few baby photos of me sprinkled in.  He sat me down with them and showed me each picture one by one, saying, ""What a beautiful baby!  What beautiful children!"" for each picture of him and my aunt.  When he got to a picture of me, he said, ""Well, that's an ok baby.""  I then told my parents that we were not trying for children at the moment.  I got Essure, and let my parents believe whatever they wanted as to why grandchildren had not materialized.  (I was a late-in-life baby, so maybe they thought we were having trouble conceiving?  Who knows?  Who cares?)  Anyway, they've both passed away.

My in-laws, on the other hand ... MIL is baby-rabid.  She cornered us immediately after our wedding ceremony and demanded that we start trying for a baby right away.

"I got a tubal ligation with Filshie clips. I was afraid of Essure as it has nickel and I have too many allergies. 

I decided on a tubal ligation with Filshie Clips because it has the best effective rate I could find (lifetime effective rate of 99.75% see: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16259814). 

Cost: Because of the new health care law the entire procedure was 100% covered. 

My surgery was scheduled for 8:00 am on Friday. At around 6:30 am, I changed into the hospital gown and signed my sterilization consent form. 

I told the anesthesiologist that I get nauseous under general anesthesia so they put a patch behind my ear to help. My doctor came by to double check everything.  BTW, everyone was very professional.

Then one of the nurses gave me an IV (they numb the area first). I peed so I wouldnât need a catheter (and I didnât). The nurse then put blue leg warmers on my legs to help prevent blood clots. Then right around 8:00 am the anesthesiologist came and gave me valium through the IV. I said bye to my husband and I was then rolled into the OR (don't even remember that part really). 

Post-OP:
I woke up wide awake (not sure the time because no contacts). The patch  worked so I was not nauseous. The nurse asked my pain scale and I was at a 3/10. It was basically a bad period cramp type of feeling, but no real âpainâ per se. The doctor came back and told me everything was normal and that the actual procedure took 15 minutes. She made the first incision into my belly button (but because she was so awesome no scar there). The second incision is below my bikini line. She then went to talk to my husband to give him the details and tell him after care instructions. 

After 30 minutes or so I was moved into the big recovery area. The nurse brought me food and juice. My husband came in and was really surprised how awake and normal I was. After 30 minutes of being in the big recovery area, I got dressed by myself and left. We left around 10:00 am.

Tips: Wear loose fitting PJs and a thin maxi pad. Bring a bottle of water to drink after as your throat is sore from breathing tube. Have a pillow in the car for the seat belt. 

Recovery:

I went home and slept. I took GasX (I looked bloated) don't know if it helped but I had no gas pain. I could walk around fine, I was just tired. The pain pills made me even more tired. I really wasn't in much pain, but I had pills so why not? ;) 

Saturday was a normal day at home. I showered (I was careful around the glue on my incisions). After the shower I felt more like me. I just watched TV all day with my husband. I was sore, but just like too many sit-ups sore. Sunday we went to brunch and did errands. I was still off/sore/tired but I was fine. I went back to work on Monday. 

Tips: Heating pad and Popsicles 

Summary: It was way simpler and easy than I thought! I have one tiny 1/2 inch scar below my bikini line that is slowly fading. The tubal ligation was the best thing I ever did! If you are considering it, stop waiting and book it! 

Ask me anything.

"I went through years of this. My longest period was 25 months. I had blood transfusions and iron infusions. I was really sick. I finally had my doctors submit why continuing to have a period was dangerous to my health.

And she needed to stop pushing that on me simply because society told us that all women want to be mothers. I had to get Essure before my ablation, simply because after one, it is deadly to conceive. After three months they tested my tubes and as soon as the image showed they are closed, I was scheduled for ablation! 

My suggestion would be to present your doctor with the opinion from your cardio about ho dangerous bleeding is. Express that hormones haven't helped and you have exhausted every other option.

"The soon-to-be ex (apartment shopping as we speak) and I are also 24. He knew when we started dating that I could not physically carry a pregnancy to term, and that I had 2 failed Essure attempts as well (he even drove me to once and took care of me after) before my tubal last month. When we started dating, he said that he was starting to consider my line of thought, which I took as a good sign. 

Fast forward to him refusing to sign a lease with me on a new house or apartment with much-needed space for us and our toys (3-4 cars, motorcycle and trailer between three two of us, and he's been staying in my tiny 1BR apartment), and I knew it'd be a waste of both our time to stay in a relationship with an expiration date, so after about a year, we're going separate ways. 

Also, I don't think many men who want kids consider that they need time to find (and marry, and buy a home with if desired) their future baby mama, then allow time to conceive, birth, recover, repeat, for desired amount of kids. For example, he wants two kids, 6 years apart. Assuming he wifes someone in 3 years, and she is the same age, she'll be 27. If they go for baby 1 on the honeymoon and don't have any issues conceiving, she'll be 28 when it's born, barring any complications. Then, wait six years, and she's 34, and risks start going up, yadda yadda. 

My bf was taken aback when I put more thought into his vague child making plan in a few seconds than he ever had.

"ORIGINAL POST (which I deleted from just above this, because I'm a dumbass):

------------------------------------------------------------------

We've been married almost 18 years. Kids were never on the agenda.
This fall, my husband is quitting his job, and we're going to spend six weeks driving through Spain, France and Italy. We're in our early 40's and we're thrilled that we can enjoy ourselves without the financial/familial burdens that most of our peers are dealing with.

------------------------------------------------------------------

...Then, um, insert LakewaterHair's response here...

------------------------------------------------------------------

Yeah, full-on retiring!  in fourteen weeks! 

If anyone's reading this who's not sure if they want to go all the way and get a Vasectomy or Tubal Ligation (or Essure, etc, etc.) here's some food for thought:

It's about money and free-time. We live pretty frugally, it's true, but because when we want to splurge, we go big. 

* We paid off both our cars early, and take good care of them. 
* We saved up for 8 years, and we **own** - *as in ""no mortgage""* - our dreamhouse: 1600 sq ft, with only one bedroom **;-)** .  
* We've been saving again, since that got finished, and now we've got a nice nest egg. We estimate our future living expenses to be under $800/mo, (property taxes, food, utilities, gasoline, etc... That spreadsheet is a work of art.) 
* we avoid paying interest as much as we can. I had college loans (once in '92's and again in '03) but both were paid off early. We have no credit card debt, no car loans, no mortgage, and no personal debts.  
* There's no way we could do afford to do either the extended Europe trip or the job-quitting if we had kids.

And before anyone says how ""lucky"" we are, my husband never earned a degree, and worked his way up from ""gopher"" to Sr. Director over a 25-year career. He'd be on track for VP if he stayed.

So, that was the money part: This is the free-time part:  I work for myself, but it's freelance. I don't earn any regular, steady income. I clear just over $2k/month after taxes.  We BOTH made a choice that my job wouldn't be full-time, so I take care of the house, and our dogs, and I take care of us. We don't go to PTA meetings. We don't shuttle kids to &amp; from sports. We don't spend time helping with busy-work homework or rehearsing for school plays or any of the other stuff we hear our nieces &amp; nephews need to do before and after school. (and back to the money, no braces for their teeth, no fortune spent on prom, no saving up for college...)

Someone already downvoted my original post, and it's likely that if anyone reads this they'll downvote it too...  but I'm not writing this to brag, and I'm not writing for karma, ***I'm writing because it's another way for people to see what life without kids can be like.***  Not having kids was a choice we made because we want to live OUR OWN LIVES and not be enslaved to kids.

"Tubal ligations carry a much larger risk as they are done under a general anaesthetic. Vasectomies are by local only.

A laproscopic Tubal has a recovery time of 2-4 days, Its a day-procedure. However you are not allowed to lift anything over 2kg for 2 weeks. This drastically limits the amount of work you can do professionally and domestically, as a load of laundry and a quality frying pan can weight this much.

If you have an open tubal, which is sometimes required based on your anatomical structure, it's a 2 week recovery, with a 6 week lift limit.

"&gt;That's part of why I won't use Essure, since it uses the same tools. 

Same!

&gt;I absolutely believe IV sedation and epidurals should be available for insertion and if there was an equivalent procedure for male people they would be available to them. As it is, male people are given local anesthetic during vasectomies because they'd be terribly painful without it, and there's no reason the same logic shouldn't apply to IUDs. Really, local is used for the implant, too, but something about plunging six inches into female reproductive organs makes people think it's okay not to offer pain relief? 

Yes exactly :( It's so horrible. It feels so... I don't know the word. Because it's my vagina and it's fast, this is fine? If it were this level of pain anywhere else, I'd get some sort of better numbing? It seems so dystopian, creepy, horrible. I don't understand why it's okay.

"A hysterectomy is a more invasive procedure with a longer recovery period, and it can cause other issues like incontinence. It's also more expensive, and I would most likely have to go to Seattle to get it done the way I want it. (I would want it done vaginally.) I live in Alaska, and the only doctors I know of who do the vaginal procedure here are in a different city, have poor reputations, and have performed it on *very* few patients. Having to go elsewhere for the surgery adds more expense and complications to the procedure and recovery. Just a round trip ticket would be about $1,000 or more. 

If these procedures don't work out, my next choice would just to be remove the source of the problem entirely and go for a hysterectomy, but again that may take time, money, a referral, and a different doctor which I don't have yet. Since the referral is for a more complicated procedure, and I may run into difficulty finding someone to go for that before I try all other options. If I can leave my organs intact and be free of pain, so much the better, so I wanted to try for this first.

Thankfully, I didn't get any flack from either doctor. I was expecting to, as I've heard that it can be incredibly difficult for women to find a doctor who will perform any sort of sterilization treatment on a woman who either does not have any children or is under the age of 35 or so. Since I'm 27 and have never been pregnant, I figured it would be a struggle. My previous experience with doctors had also taught me that, by and large, they do not take women's reproductive health problems seriously or even view them as worth noting. But I think the doctors were impressed, not only with how long I'd had to deal with such awful things, but also with how much research I'd done and how well thought out all of my reasons for wanting the surgery are. The fact that they were both women who have experience with these procedures personally also may have helped. I may find doctors in the future who criticize me for it, and based on the general attitudes I've encountered regarding female sterilization I probably will at some point, but for now I'm okay.

My plan was always to save up some money, move to Washington state for a while, and seek out doctors that I'd seen recommended over and over again by younger women who simply don't want children. I would look into an ablation with essure or hysterectomy and compare their prices, procedures, and attitudes. There are some very unique health programs in Washington state to aid in women becoming sterilized, and since I've always wanted to live there and could be closer to my extended family from that move, it seemed like a great bonus. But, I figured that would be several years and many thousands of dollars saved down the line.

"To add to what's already been said, your other options are IUDs and hormonal implants. Neither is permanent, but they last 3-10 years and you can get a new one put in when the old one is taken out. They're vastly easier to get than sterilization and just as effective.

If your natural periods (when not on the pill or anything else) don't cause you a lot of hassle, tubal ligation or bilateral salpingectomy is a good option. If you feel better with your hormones regulated by the pill or some other form of hormonal BC, an implant or Mirena IUD may be better. Sterilization doesn't typically cause long-term side effects, but returning to an unregulated cycle after being on BC can be unpleasant.

Hysterectomy is fairly major surgery to remove an organ and probably isn't a good idea unless you have endometriosis or some other condition that means your uterus is causing you problems beyond being a possible baby hosting space.

"There is a lot of false information floating around out there. Part of the issue is that outdated, inaccurate, and complicated medical research is being misinterpreted by the public, or purposely misused by organizations pushing their own agendas. I have experience with this sort of thing through my grad school study, and it is a common problem in the wider dissemination of academic literature. All academic literature must be looked at critically- what are the authorâs biases? Have the results of the study been replicated by other researchers? Did the authors make assumptions or ignore important factors? What is the sample size for their data? Did they state the limitations of their study and further research needed? 

What limited evidence there is for post-tubal ligation syndrome seems to be from complications where blood flow to ovaries are damaged in some way accidentally, but the existence and cause of the syndrome appears to be debated. This sort of damage may have been more common in earlier, less refined surgical methods and implantation treatments like Essure. While all surgeries carry risks, a modern salpingectomy with a surgeon who knows what they are doing will carry little risk. 

The only thing I found online that claimed 37% of people experience post-tubal ligation syndrome was from a company that specializes in fertility treatments. They do not cite a source for their claim (a huge red flag) and as a company that offers reversal of the procedure to treat the syndrome their bias cannot be ignored. Frankly, they are trying to sell someone tubal reversal procedures, so they are going to exaggerate the claims they make about the risks and the services they offer for âtreatment.â Their website is not providing accurate medical information.

OP, I would recommend finding a doctor in your area from the list offered on the sub and call their office to make a consultation appointment to ask these questions. They can give you clearer information about side effects and risks than you will get with an internet search. I would try to pick one from the list or only consult with obgyns who perform the surgery for sterilization purposes - there are absolutely biased doctors out there who donât think people should be able to make these choices for themselves, and will overplay the risks or try to make you doubt a commitment to a childfree lifestyle/sterilization. A salpingectomy is also sometimes performed to assist with IVF (I donât know why, but I now have to specify on forms that my procedure was for sterilization to avoid awkward conversation with medical staff who instead assume Iâm trying to get pregnant), so just because a doctor offers the service it doesnât mean they offer it for sterilization.

"To be honest the overall procedure and recovery was less painful than when I got my Mirena IUD. Part of that may be because they gave me pain medicine to take before the Essure procedure (and I was only given ibprofen for the Mirena insert). With the Mirena I had some intense cramping for a few days post insert (and heavy bleeding for a few days), while I actually only had minor cramping the evening after my Essure insert (and two days of light spotting). I was sent home with pain meds for the Essure, but I did not end up taking any after the procedure (just ibprofen), since I felt fine (I taught the following day and even went to the gym to do cardio). 

I was pretty surprised with the difference, I was expecting it to be worse than the IUD, since it was a longer procedure, but overall very easy.

"I went to my OB/GYN at 23 wanting the Paragard because it lasted 10 years and was hormone free. She talked with me candidly about it and gave me some information on Mirena. She was happy to insert either one depending on my choice but really felt I'd be happier with the Mirena. In the end I got the Mirena and was sooo glad I did.

It takes about six months after insertion before you stop having periods completely. No cramps, no bloating and no more crazy hormones that made me feel nuts. I was typical of most women where my hormones stayed localized to my uterus. Some women are more sensitive where any hormone will give them issues even if it's the low dose Mirena provides.

If you don't want to do Mirena the Paragard is an excellent second choice. I doubt you'll find anyone that will be willing to sterilize you so young so you will likely have to opt for that. You will have heavier periods but at least you'll have peace of mind that you won't get pregnant.

"If you don't get the dye test you are risking pregnancy. So Essure is not right for you :( 

A tubal ligation is simpler and easier than you think: 

I got a tubal ligation with Filshie clips. It was super simple and easy. 

I decided on a tubal ligation with Filshie Clips because it has the best effective rate I could find (lifetime effective rate of 99.75% see: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16259814). 

Cost: Because of the new health care law the entire procedure was 100% covered. 

My surgery was scheduled for 8:00 am on Friday. At around 6:30 am, I changed into the hospital gown and signed my sterilization consent form. 

I told the anesthesiologist that I get nauseous under general anesthesia so they put a patch behind my ear to help. My doctor came by to double check everything.  BTW, everyone was very professional.

Then one of the nurses gave me an IV (they numb the area first). I peed so I wouldnât need a catheter (and I didnât). The nurse then put blue leg warmers on my legs to help prevent blood clots. Then right around 8:00 am the anesthesiologist came and gave me valium through the IV. I said bye to my husband and I was then rolled into the OR (don't even remember that part really). 

Post-OP:
I woke up wide awake (not sure the time because no contacts). The patch  worked so I was not nauseous. The nurse asked my pain scale and I was at a 3/10. It was basically a bad period cramp type of feeling, but no real âpainâ per se. The doctor came back and told me everything was normal and that the actual procedure took 15 minutes. She made the first incision into my belly button (but because she was so awesome no scar there). The second incision is below my bikini line. She then went to talk to my husband to give him the details and tell him after care instructions. 

After 30 minutes or so I was moved into the big recovery area. The nurse brought me food and juice. My husband came in and was really surprised how awake and normal I was. After 30 minutes of being in the big recovery area, I got dressed by myself and left. We left around 10:00 am.

Tips: Wear loose fitting PJs and a thin maxi pad. Bring a bottle of water to drink after as your throat is sore from breathing tube. Have a pillow in the car for the seat belt. 

Recovery:

I went home and slept. I took GasX (I looked bloated) don't know if it helped but I had no gas pain. I could walk around fine, I was just tired. The pain pills made me even more tired. I really wasn't in much pain, but I had pills so why not? ;) 

Saturday was a normal day at home. I showered (I was careful around the glue on my incisions). After the shower I felt more like me. I just watched TV all day with my husband. I was sore, but just like too many sit-ups sore. Sunday we went to brunch and did errands. I was still off/sore/tired but I was fine. I went back to work on Monday. 

Tips: Heating pad and Popsicles 

Summary: It was way simpler and easy than I thought! I have one tiny 1/2 inch scar below my bikini line that is slowly fading. The tubal ligation was the best thing I ever did! If you are considering it, stop waiting and book it!

This might be something you and your wife will have to sit down and revisit periodically before both of you comes to terms with it. That's okay. Respect each other's processes and be there for each other. 

On a personal note, I can tell you I would never want to experience something like that again if I were your wife, so it is time to make some birth control decisions. If you feel that your family is complete, you need to make sure you aren't caught in this situation again. One or both of you needs to get a permanent alteration--vasectomy, essure, etc. I had an IUD and still got pregnant, so if that's something your wife wants I would still recommend a vasectomy.

"As others have said, a hysterectomy might be difficult if done solely for sterilization. However, with your history of endo, you might have a shot, though that will depend on the extent of disease and probably first require other surgeries.

As far as your other permanent BC options:

* Tubal ligation: surgery, cutting/clamping both uterine/fallopian tubes to prevent the egg traveling to the uterus for fertilization/implantation. Low chance of successful reversal. Highly effective. If pregnancy occurs, high chance of ectopic pregnancy, which should have no trouble getting treated at an ER or doctors office. Also Post Tubal Ligation Syndrome is NOT A REAL THING. Do not be deceived by crazy online people trying to scare you (if you've never heard of it, don't bother looking it up). Uterus remains intact, meaning periods will continue as normal (may change slightly if hormonal BC changes as result of not needing it post-op).
* Bilateral Salpingectomy: surgery, complete removal of both uterine/fallopian tubes which accomplishes the same as tubal ligation, but is more effective (no documented viable pregnancies that I'm aware of), and has the additional benefit of reducing certain forms of ovarian cancer (which originate in the tube). Impossible reversal (to my knowledge). For permanent control, this is what I would recommend to a healthy person - it is also becoming standard practice. Uterus remains intact, meaning periods will continue as normal.
* Essure: hysteroscopy (through vagina/cervix/uterus - instead of through abdominal wall) metal coils inserted into each uterine/fallopian tube to cause local inflammation and scar tissue. This forms a physical barrier to block fertilization/implantation. Highly effective, if pregnancy occurs, it will likely be ectopic as well, easily treated. While this method is effective, since it relies on foreign material, there have been documented allergic reactions (be wary if you've have poor response to metals previously), and doctors are doing this procedure less in favor of bil salp. Uterus remains intact, meaning periods will continue as normal.
* Hysterectomy: irreversible (obviously), but not usually done (or rather covered by insurance) JUST for the purpose of sterilization. Can be covered for medical reasons (painful fibroids, hemorrhage, certain cancers, etc.) with the added benefit of sterilization. There are various ""flavors"" of hysterectomy in which organs/tissues are removed. Cervix, uterine/fallopian tubes, ovaries can be removed or left depending on the indication (ex. if it's invasive cancer, everything may be taken, vs a large/painful fibroid just the uterus, tubes, cervix). If at least 1 ovary is left intact (most likely for your case), there would be no hormonal changes (no menopause).

Talk to your doctor honestly about your goals. Don't be pushed aside due to your age or nulliparity (remember there is NO scientific evidence to support a minimum age or number of children prior to sterilization to prevent/significantly decrease risk of regret). If the doctor bingos you about these things, stand your ground, and ask for the evidence they're basing it on.

"Your professor is in 100% incorrect (well unless they are referring to permanent birth control, which is a vasectomy, tubal ligation, Essure, tube removal, etc.)

So I assume a religious school? 

But here is a quick and reliable breakdown:

&gt; Letâs look, for example, at how long it takes for women to get pregnant when they quit the pill compared to when they quit non-hormonal fertility awareness methods (FAM, sometimes called natural family planning). A big study of over 2,000 women who quit the pill after using it for an average of seven years found that 21% were pregnant in one month and 79% were pregnant in a year. **Women who stopped using FAM had very similar rates of pregnancy, with 20-25% pregnant in one month and 80% pregnant in a year. In other words, women who quit the pill get pregnant just as fast as other women, even if theyâve used the pill for years.**

&gt; Women who quit the patch, ring, or IUD get pregnant at similar rates. Contrary to popular myth, modern IUDs do not hurt your future fertility. For some women who stop using the implant or the shot (Depo-Provera), it can take a few extra *months* to start normal menstrual cycles again.

"You can either get your Fallopian tubes ligated (multiple ways of doing this, cut, cauterize, etc), a bilateral salpingectomy (removal of both Fallopian tubes), or get essure (device put in Fallopian tubes that mimics ligation) if you want to be sterilized via your Fallopian tubes.

All the answers to your questions are in the sub's FAQ : 

###[Did you all have awful childhoods or something?](https://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/wiki/faq#wiki_did_you_all_have_awful_childhoods_or_something.3F)

###[Why is there such backlash against being childfree?](https://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/wiki/faq#wiki_why_is_there_such_backlash_against_being_childfree.3F) 

Stereotypes and prejudice explain the criticism the childfree face. Some people consider this life choice as selfish (for various reasons), as an insult/dismissal to their own life choice, as a proof of character flaws, etc. There are also people who seem to think that all childfree people must probably hate children because if we did like kids, why would we refuse to have them?

Nothing is monolithically true that it can or should justify such an adverse reaction but, unfortunately, contempt or at least lack of understanding is something we might have to face at some point whether online or not.

and in the sub's FAQ ('Newcomer' --&gt; 'Frequent Posts' --&gt; ' **""You guys complain a lot. Why are there so many rants?""** It's important for everyone to have a space to vent, and sadly this is one of the very few we have.')  :

&gt; ###'Do childfree people dislike children and their parents?
&gt; 
&gt; No. Not all childfree people dislike children or their parents. The only hallmark required to be a childfree person is not desiring children. Some childfree people choose to have children play a large role in their lives by pursuing teaching or childcare careers, and some choose to omit children from their lives as much as possible.
&gt; 
&gt; ###Then why are there frequent posts complaining about them?
&gt; 
&gt; Many of us live in a world in which it is socially absolutely unacceptable to criticize any aspect of pregnancy, children, or their parents for any reason. As a result, many of us need a supportive outlet for being able to express our frustration with any of those things. For many of us, r/childfree is our place to vent and express exasperation.""'
&gt; 
&gt; What I think a lot of people don't understand, is that, this is the *only* safe place for **many** of us to talk negatively about children. When we do say anything outside of here, we usually get called child-haters, and the implications of that can mean losing friends, being branded as a monster, or being berated and shunned into silence. Saying anything negative in the real world, heck, most parts of the internet even, is a good way to get reprimanded. 
&gt; 
&gt; If we want to gush about children, we can go *anywhere*. And the [people](http://imgur.com/BzjAr1j)^[1]  [who](http://imgur.com/LskGSRO)^[2] [like](http://imgur.com/zlOh1Px)^[3]  [kids](http://imgur.com/uSc6BH4)^[4]    [get](http://imgur.com/jgEY9zE)^[5] [this](http://imgur.com/DQSiJn0)^[6]. 
&gt; 
&gt; If you don't believe me on the anywhere? There's plenty of places on reddit for those who like children.
&gt; 
&gt; /r/Parenting
&gt; 
&gt; /r/cutekids
&gt; 
&gt; /r/newparents
&gt; 
&gt; /r/cutebabies
&gt; 
&gt; That was just through a few minutes of searching, I'm sure if I dug deeper I could find loads more, and that's just on reddit! Personally, as I'm living with my parents(moving out soon, but that's a different story), I can't tell my parents.  They won't even believe my decision is serious. They'll tell me that I'm too young to know my own mind, my dad will say I'm disobeying a commandment from God(not taking a second to think about the fact that I'm atheist). This is the only safe place I can go to rant. I am not around kids a lot in my day to day life, but in case I come across some miniature human that's insufferable, I have a safe place to share my frustration with others.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; One point that seems to be floating around is. ""For people who don't want kids, you talk about them a lot.""
&gt; 
&gt; For that, I give thanks to /u/voteforabetterpotato for this perfect analogy.
&gt; 
&gt; ""I told a colleague about my vasectomy over lunch and how I'm happily childfree. She told me ""Are you sure you're not in denial? Because for someone who doesn't want kids, you sure talk about it often"". I came up with a good analogy: I asked her if she likes blue cheese. She said no.
&gt; 
&gt; So I said, imagine if everyone on earth loved blue cheese except you. It was all over Facebook. It's all people ever talked about. Family functions were hours of people talking about blue cheese and how you're just telling yourself that you don't like blue cheese, but you'll change your mind and that everyone wants blue cheese poured over everything eventually.
&gt; 
&gt; Wouldn't that make you anti-blue cheese? So against the idea of blue cheese everywhere that you'd vent about it with friends at every opportunity?""
&gt; 
&gt; This concept is especially true if you've never been fond of blue cheese, you struggled trying to figure out if blue cheese was for you or not, and got flack from anyone you voiced your concerns to. Blue cheese in this scenario being children of course.
&gt; 
&gt; I would just like to wrap up with one more thing, this has been hitting home, as I'm one of the ""younger"" ones on the sub. I'm 20 years old. From what I've seen, a lot of new members coming to this reddit are my age, and a 21 year old female just got approved for Essure. Before, I continue, I would like to refer to something on the rules once more.

I hope this will be helpful.

I wanted to get essure, but need to talk myself into the pain of the process (apparently the checkup is infinitely more painful for most women than the initial procedure).

Nor do I favor the idea of having anything inserted inside my uterus no matter how much I dislike children.

"I had my Essure done last month (about a week before I turned 26). Prior to doing so I talked to my fiance (who also doesn't want children) and told him this is for sure happening, never any children. He was on board, and my mom is the one that drove me to and from the appointment. (Which is awesome, since I had to be there incredibly early, and she lives an hour away.) Most of my family and friends don't know for sure that I'm never having children. Anytime kids are brought up I tell them I don't want them, but they just brush it off. My father still doesn't know I had the procedure done (we don't have the best relationship.)

Congratulations to you! If you have any questions, there are tons of people on here that have had, or are looking into the procedure. After I had mine done, /u/sexychippy was extremely helpful (she works in an OR) with any questions that were coming in my post.

"Check /r/childfree and /r/sterilization 

Here is mine:

I was late 20s, married, no kids and I wanted to find a more permanent birth control method. So I started researching what the procedure ""tying your tubes"" entailed / read a ton of experiences after my Paragard partially expelled at one year.   

I decided on a tubal ligation with Filshie clips. It has the best effective rate I could find (lifetime average effective rate of 99.75% see: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16259814 or http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/24560346/?i=1&amp;amp;amp;amp;from=filshie%20clips)

So I scheduled an appointment with my OBGYN, she is on the younger side and very openminded (there is a link in the sidebar to open minded doctors if you don't have a open minded OBGYN). We had a 30 minute conversation and she agreed that I was well researched / she was comfortable I understood it was permanent. After the consult, I discussed with her scheduling nurse when I would prefer to schedule it (it was around 3 months out). 

Cost: During my research, I triple checked the ACA law required the insurance to 100% cover it. I paid about $10 for the at home pain pills. So in *total* it cost me only $10.00! Check out www.coverher.org for info about that! 

Pre-Op:

Since it was scheduled 3 months after the consult the hospital required my doctor to do a Pre-Op with me. So week of procedure I had a Pre-Op apt with my Doctor. Basically just a quick check of everything. I asked whether I needed a catheter and she doubted I would. She gave no restrictions as to sex or exercise and just resume when comfortable. Got my pain prescriptions and pre-filled them so I could go straight home after my tubal ligation. Definitely ask to get them pre-filled. 

Procedure: 

It was scheduled for 8:00 am on Friday. Hospital told me to check in at 6-6:15 am for paperwork / prep. Paperwork was just double checking everything (copy of insurance card / etc). Walked to a private mini hospital room and Nurse started intake / asking health questions (when did I eat last, what medications/ etc) and changed into the hospital gown and signed my sterilization consent form. Doctor also stopped by to chat before. I told the anesthesiologist that I get nauseous under general anesthesia so they put a patch behind my ear to help. Then one of the nurses gave me an IV (they numb the area first). I peed right before so I wouldnât need a catheter (and I didnât). The nurse then put blue leg warmers on my legs to help prevent blood clots (this is normal for any procedure). Around 8:00 am the anesthesiologist came and gave me valium through the IV. Later I was then rolled into the OR. I don't even really remember leaving the room - they have some good drugs :)

Post-OP:
I woke up wide awake in the recovery area. The patch worked so I was not nauseous. The nurse asked my pain scale and I was at a 3/10. It was basically a bad period cramp type of feeling, but no real âpainâ per se. The doctor came back and told me everything was normal and that the actual procedure took 15 minutes. She made the first incision into my belly button (but because she was so awesome no scar there). The second small incision is below my bikini line. She then went to talk to my husband to give him the details and tell him after care instructions. 

After 30 minutes or so I was moved into the big recovery area. The nurse brought me food and juice. My husband came in and was really surprised how awake and normal I was. After 30 minutes of being in the big recovery area, I got dressed by myself and left. We left around 10:00 am. 

Tips: Wear loose fitting PJs and a thin maxi pad. Bring a bottle of water to drink after as your throat is sore. Have a pillow in the car for the seat belt. 

At-Home Recovery:

Friday: 
I went home and slept. I could walk around fine, I was just tired. I walked up the stairs to my bedroom by myself. My tummy was a tiny bit inflated by the gas they use to see what they are doing in there, but nothing crazy, it just looked like I had eaten a big meal / slight bloat. 
The pain pills made more tired so I just slept the rest of the day. I late lunch and dinner normally. 

Saturday and Sunday: 
The rest of the weekend, I just watched TV with my husband. I could do stuff, I just chose to relax. Basically it was just a lazy weekend. Have some good movies and shows to watch. I was sore, but just like too many sit-ups sore. I could have done errands if I needed to, but with the pain pills you aren't suppose to drive.

Monday:
I went back to work on Monday. No prescription pain pills and just did over the counter stuff Monday and Tuesday. No one even guessed anything :) The worst thing was really from the IV (big bruise as my veins hate IVs) but just wore long sleeve shirts for a few days. 

Tips: Heating pad for tummy and Popsicles for your throat. 

Summary: It was way simpler and easier than I thought! I have one tiny 1/2 inch scar below my bikini line that faded. The tubal ligation was the best thing I ever did! 

P.S. Don't fall for the fake ""Post Tubal ligation Syndrome."" The 'doctor' that created it, lost her license (http://www.casewatch.org/board/med/hufnagel/order_2004.shtml or http://caselaw.findlaw.com/ca-court-of-appeal/1230512.html) for being crazy.

Neither a tubal ligation (tubes tied),  bilateral salpingectomy (tube removal), nor Essure (blocking your tubes) will effect your hormones. Women usually  stop hormonal birth control when they get their tubes tied. As in they return to their natural period. Hormonal birth stops your cycle so you neither ovulate nor have a period so when you are on it you have a lighter fake bleed. Correlation is NOT causation.

Some of the research disproving the fake syndrome - they didn't even find correlation, let alone causation: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7982548 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11106717 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15865627 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23071889

Why? Because it can't /won't restrict the blood flow after surgery. This explains it quite well...

"I had mine inserted in July 2015. I don't really remember the pain to be honest. It was more like a really bad period cramp, which I was used to already. I was basically in and out and it was no big deal.

But I honestly want to and plan to get mine removed.

I had terrible, terrible cramps for the first three months. I was a server at the time and I have a pretty high pain tolerance, but these cramps would stop me in the middle of the dining room or serving aisle and I would double over in pain until it subsided. 

I also had terrible acne on my face up until about November. Deep, cystic acne. It left a lot of dark marks on my face. While my face has calmed down and I'm currently only getting small white heads, the cystic acne has moved to my shoulders and the center of my back. 

I had minor spotting for about fourth months but I primarily experienced a large amount of discharge. All the time. Non stop. The discharge ended up getting a fowl, rotting smelling odor. I went to my doctor twice for this, two rounds of antibiotics, but they never found any trace of infection. Usually just tiny traces of yeast but not enough to be concerned about. But I was prescribed the antibiotics anyway, as a precaution, and round two of them did take away the odor and eventually the discharge.

I was ""dry"" for all of November and December and the first half of January. The other day I randomly started cramping and getting discharge again. I then spotted once this past Monday. And now an odor is back. Although it smells like a bad cheese this time. I don't know if that's because I'm having a false period of sorts or what is causing it. 

I will be switching to a new insurance here very soon and it looks like they cover Essure so I will be looking into that (because I don't want kids). But as soon as my insurance is all sorted out, I will be going back to the doctor to get this thing removed (and probably another round of antibiotics). It's been nothing but a terrible pain in the ass.

I'm not trying to scare you, this is just my experience. And everyone's bodies react differently. I have a handful of piercings and all healed up with no issues so my thinking going into this was ""My body hasn't reacted to foreign objects. Mirena should be fine."" And that wasn't the case. Unfortunately, I experienced a lot of the bad stories I read online.

If your insurance will cover yours, I would recommend it simply because you're always going to hear/read more bad stories than good when searching online.

"Except the article makes no mention of any evidence of any kind being presented that she was not using some form of contraception, only that he felt mislead that she was using contraception and using it *correctly.* (since this actual case in the article was dismissed, so we're talking theoretical beyond that.) 

I know at least a handful of women whose doctors told them that they are infertile or will have a hard time getting pregnant, took that to mean they can't get pregnant 100%, and who subsequently had a ""miracle"" accidental pregnancy, sometimes after years of unprotected sex. If you were to become pregnant despite a genuine belief that you were permanently infertile, should you be punished? 

If a man has a vasectomy, or a woman has the essure procedure, and they have unprotected sex with their partner too soon after the procedure to be sterile either because they didn't know better or just were stupid and got caught up in the moment, should they be punished?

I have an IUD, which many women and men believe it's ""virtually impossible"" to become pregnant on (my type of IUD actually carries a 0.8% risk of pregnancy within the first year of use, of which 0.6% are when the device is found to be in situ and 0.2% can be arguably called 'user error' in failure to recognize expulsion.) If I didn't know better and told a partner ""don't worry, I can't get pregnant on an IUD!"" and then had sex without a condom with them, should I owe my partner millions of dollars if pregnancy were to result? 

For that matter, if a man uses a condom and tells his partner that he's never had a problem with condoms before and is great at using them, and then the condom breaks because he'd unintentionally stored it improperly, or didn't use enough lube, or didn't pinch the tip before rolling it on, is he liable? 

If a woman misses her birth control pills, should she be punished? If she takes a medication that interferes with her pills, would that be ""proof"" that she mislead him?  User error causes the overwhelming majority of contraceptive failures. Should non-malicious user error be punishable? Should user error be presumed in the event of failure, in lack of evidence otherwise, given the overwhelming odds? 

As a doctor, he knew or could have reasonably have learnt [the real-world odds.]
(http://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/UnintendedPregnancy/PDF/Contraceptive_methods_508.pdf) He chose to disregard them and not use condoms, and took a gamble that a condition that he felt was life-ruining would not arise. ""I thought she was taking her birth control perfectly"" shouldn't be a reasonable argument for wrongful birth suits, *unless* there is proof that the person was not using contraception entirely or that they intentionally tampered with it. 

If there's some sort of actual evidence that the woman knowingly deceived him, in a manner comparable to a man saying he's using a condom and then not using one, or claiming to have had a vasectomy, then I'd agree that the book should be thrown at her criminally and civilly. Things like: if she admitted to not using birth control at all, or to trying to become pregnant. If she claimed to be on the pill but pharmacy records show she had not picked up any for months. If she claimed to have a contraceptive device but her doctors had no record of ever placing one. That's all clearly wrong and should be punished. 

In lack of clear malicious intent, humans are stupid, and they're fucking awful at using their contraception, but that shouldn't be considered criminal in itself.

"I didn't say we can't strive for change. I said ""right now."" What you suggest is not a feasible option right now. Making changes based on a fantasy (like the laws happening in Texas, and the laws that happened across the country in 2015) is just not practical. It's not realistic. It's not in touch with our reality. I would LOVE to see the number of women needing an abortion to be zero, but the need is still there. Cutting access doesn't cut the need. It increases the number of coat hangers being used.
 
  
If you want to see those statistics, google them. They're out there, and they're out there so that you can have an informed discussion rather than going based on making things up in your head. http://www.guttmacher.org/datacenter/profiles/US.jsp  
  
People also don't all abort because they're ""an idiot."" I've seen women who have IUDs in place, stories of consistent condom use, up-to-date use of their oral birth control all come in for abortions. I've seen women who can't get birth control through their insurance. I've seen women who have been taught that hormonal birth control is a sin so they haven't had access. I've even seen women whose husbands have had vasectomies, or who themselves have had ""essure"" come in for abortions. I've seen women who have tried birth control in the past and had strokes, so they can't take them any more. You're just proving that you don't know what you don't know. Areas with free access to contraceptives have about a 45% lower rate of abortions. That's not women being idiots. That America have poor access to basic health care services.  
  
Your life might not have been over when your wife became pregnant... and that's fantastic. It's really good. I wish every woman had that much support and love around her to be able to do that. The reality of the world can be different. I'm not saying life will be peachy for every woman who gets an abortion, but I am saying the quality of life of the child won't be used as punishment for her actions. Look at the statistics - children born into poverty or single-parent households are much more likely to become criminals. They're more likely to become pregnant as teens. They're less likely to be education. They're more likely to live in poverty. It's not always the case, but it's the case often enough that we have strong statistics to support it. The data shows hundreds of thousands of cases... you're describing one.  
  
I'm not saying anyone would be a shit parent. I'm saying women who have abortions are good parents. They know their situation, they know its wrong to bring a child into it, and they choose not to.  
  
And look at the statistics. Yes, there are many anti-abortion proponents. They're loud and obnoxious and they love to make everyone think there are more of them than there are. One third of American women aged 18-45 will have an abortion. They stay silent so they can't play on your emotions to try to change your mind.

"Apparently not so rare considering in April of this year the FDA moved to reclassify the surgical mesh as Class III (high risk). Furthermore, 750k KITS have been sold, not implanted. With a minimum 12% failure rate at implantation, multiple kits are used/discarded. That 12% failure rate is what results in migration of the coils. Those are the numbers supplied to the FDA during the PMA hearing.

Other than that I have nothing to do with Erin Brokovich other than knowing someone made a movie about her, nor have I ever done any kind of publicity/news story.

When I was about 30, a very good friend went through the ordeal of wanting children now and needing multiple years, fertility treatment etc. At that point, I realized I needed to shit or get off the pot. Still didn't want any children and am quite sure that this is for life. So it was time to find a good gynecologist.

First one was horrendous, didn't even talk to me, but explained to the attending student that women will always change their mind later yadda yadda as if I wasn't even there. I sulked for half a year. Researched options in the Netherlands, Hungary..., but ruled them out because they only offered the essure procedure, which according to my research is not what i want. For anyone.

Researched more, found out where I'd want to have the procedure done, and about the different techniques that can be used. Had a result, but still needed a referral from a gynecologist. So I systematically went down the jameda list in my city, ruling out anyone who operates themself, encountering ""we don't take new patients"" at least ten times and finally got lucky. Very lucky - one of the best gynecologists I ever had, and I'm glad to now have one - now I'm getting my yearly checkups again.

That gynecologist still asked me some questions like ""And how if your partner changes his mind about wanting children?"" - ""Then he's not the right partner for me and should leave me for another woman, preferably younger"". I think he realized that my mind was set and I'd go doctor shopping until i got what i wanted, he said something like this. The fact that I had very clear answers about where I wanted this done, had researched cost and circumstances, probably helped with establishing that this decision on my part was well-considered. Also explained afterwards that the questions were necessary for the informed consent part.

Got my operation, am happy like a clam about it. Still get comments from medical providers about the procedure on my file. I handle those by interpreting them as purely professional requests about the underlying reason, and answering with ""it was elective"" ... ""Because I don't want children. Duh."". Works fine so far.

So - should this all have been easier? Should I have been able to go to the doctor as a 20-year old, got respected, got given all that information I had to research myself, and then *maybe* been told to think about it for half a year? Abso-fucking-lutely!

It's simply your choice. If you don't want to have kids, don't have kids.

"We have a list of childfree-friendly doctors on this sub.

Look into a hysterectomy extensively, though. Thereâs a lot of bad complications you could have, turns out the uterus helps keep other organs in the right place etc. Taking it out has more implications than just âno babiesâ so do lots of research and be very sure. You could also get a bilaterial scalp(??) where both fallopian tubes are removed for a 100% sterilization rate. Just something to consider. 

I too wanted a hysterectomy and after learning about it more I decided to wait a while and pursue essure for now. 

I have a friend who got one, though, because of her bad endo. Her doctor removed it for that reason. You mentioned you have that so maybe that will make it easier for you to find a doc or more necessary for you specifically, therefore more pros to weigh against the cons.

"If you've never had surgery or been in a hospital, it makes sense that you'd be scared of it, but from what I've heard, abortion is no picnic either. The abortion pill leads to at least a day of pain and bleeding and you still have to deal with some pregnancy hormones. Getting it surgically removed requires you to have a sedative as well and can be traumatic, even for women who really want it and who say afterwards that it was worth it. I've heard too many stories about how painful either method is (I don't believe life begins at conception, so there isn't the morality issue for me) to want to have one, though I would if I needed it. I've had an elective surgery with general anesthesia and it went fine, so I guess it's easier for me to not be worried about any possible side effects. Bad side effects from anesthesia can happen, but they're so rare, unlike pregnancy especially off the pill.

I'm totally with you on not getting an IUD or Essure (I want a tubal in a couple years), I don't think I could deal with insertion/removal pain. I'm a fan of general anesthesia.

So I ended up going about five procedures to finally be healthy. Essure implant (couldnât afford it, so no anasthesia) test for failure, (without anasthesia), tubal, biopsy and finally the hysterectomy. Throughout all of this I had endometriosis and like you, six month periods. It was a long recovery from all of this, but I am so happy itâs done.

"BTW, the safest (0 morbidity/mortality), cheapest, and MOST EFFECTIVE method is VASECTOMIES.

2. Past history of attempting to seek permanent contraception. 

I initially realised that I was unwilling to produce and raise children was when I was 14, in 2002. This caused considerable anxiety as I perceived a world where motherhood was not a choice. Prior to this I had not considered the matter. I did, however, spend most of my childhood refusing to engage in play that involved pretending a doll or object was a child or baby.

On entering university in March 2006 I was able to connect with like-minded individuals both online and in person and came to the realisation that motherhood was a choice - a choice I immediately rejected. At this time I started oral contraception and saved $700 in cash from working summer jobs to facilitate an abortion should I become pregnant. I was unaware at the time that a Medicare (Australian goverment funding for medical care/procedures) rebate applies to abortions. 

At the age of 20, in 2007 I became concerned about the risks of missing a pill or having vomiting or diahorrea, and consequently experiencing an unwanted pregnancy. At the time I decided to pursue a contraceptive method that did not carry these risks. On exploration of these methods I came across the âtubal ligationâ - a permanent method which, as I understood it, would block or remove the fallopian tubes. This appealed to me as it was a permanent method, even though, like all contraceptive methods, there is a chance of failure. I started a relationship with my now fiance in March 2008. 

On visiting my GP in (hometown) in 2008, at the age of 21, I requested a tubal ligation and was laughed at and and advised to continue with the pill. I sought a second opinion from a GP at the (trendy part of city), also in 2008. I chose this clinic as I had hoped, being in a socially alternative part of Sydney, they may be more open to discussion regarding tubal ligation. When I requested the procedure I was advised, âcome back when youâre 30 and weâll talkâ. 

After this reaction, I then explored other options and decided to accept Implanon as a temporary measure until I could garner approval for the tubal ligation. Ongoing research had lead me to realise that the tubal ligation needed specialist care, and my approach changed from requesting the procedure to requesting a referral instead. 

My third consultation was at a general practice in Sydney CBD who declined to refer me for the tubal ligation, but consented to Implanon. I was able to have this fitted in May 2010. After two years of persisting through these symptoms outlined on page 1 I returned to the original practice I visited in the (hometown) to have Implanon removed. I was then placed on Microgynon in July 2012.   

My fourth and fifth requests for a referral were in 2013, when I enquired about âEssureâ. The two (different) GPs I visited were unsure about this procedure and suggested that it may not be available in Australia at the present time. Later research led me to turn away from wanting these procedures and I returned to my original plan of requesting a referral for a tubal ligation. 

My 6th, 7th and 8th requests for a referral for tubal ligation were carried out on December 2013, May 2014 and December 2014 when I presented for prescription repeats for the pill. By this time I was 25 and taking Yaz due to experiencing severe mood swings on Microgynon. These were affecting my clinical and theoretical performance at university. Each time I was refused and advised to continue on with Yaz. This was despite my anxiety around relying on this method of contraception. 

At my 9th consultation with a new GP (in hometown) for a routine pap smear in April 2015, the GP asked if I was considering starting a family. I advised her that I did not want children and my partner was supportive of this. I then requested a referral for a tubal ligation. My GP then advised me, quote, âah, you just havenât met the right fellowâ. At this time I had been with my fiance for 7 years and we were preparing to get engaged. 

My 10th consultation in August 2015 in the (hometown) I was refused a tubal ligation and offered the Mirena IUD. I declined this option. I was not offered a non hormonal IUD at this appointment, however I do not wish to pursue a non hormonal IUD either, for reasons described in page 1. 

At my 11th consultation in (rural town), again in August 2015, where I was working at the time, I asked about the procedure. At this appointment, the doctor was empathetic but refused me the procedure on the grounds that âyour partner can just get a vasectomyâ. I do not wish to go down this route because:
(personal info about fiance - deleted for this post) 
I am aware that male sterilisation is a simpler process than female sterilisation and can be done under local anaesthetic. Considering this, my stance on children is my own, while my partner is supportive of this and has been throughout our relationship, I would feel more comfortable if I was the infertile one in our relationship and eventual marriage. 
Should our relationship fail for any reason I do not wish to have to return to hormonal contraception to supplement the recommended barrier methods should I begin dating again 

In November 2015 my now fiance and I became engaged. We will be getting married in March 2017. 

At my 12th consultation in January 2016 at (new dr, hometown), I was able to have a discussion about the procedure and obtain a referral to you. 





3. Statement of consent 

Throughout the process of trying to get a tubal ligation I have been counselled on the risks and implications of this surgery. As a result, I declare that I understand and accept the following risks and implications. I declare that I am of sound mind and am not being coerced into this statement or the procedure. I am aware this document may require amendment should any item be incorrect.

This is a permanent procedure. It is designed to be irrevocable. Any reversal attempts would have a limited chance of success. By choosing a bilateral salpingectomy, I acknowledge that I would be effectively eliminating the chance of a successful reversal. [1]
Approximately 20.3% of women under the age of 30 express regret following the procedure. Despite this finding, I am confident and sure in my mind that I do not and will not ever want children for the reasons outlined in page 1-2. In addition, of note, this study has also found that women under the age of 30 had the lowest rate of regret in this group if they had no previous births (6.3%). [2]
In vitro fertilisation has, at best, a 37% success rate [3] and in most cases the success rate is closer to 25%. Therefore I am aware that IVF will be unlikely to produce a child after I have this procedure. I am also aware that IVF will cost approximately $8000-$15000 per cycle, with many clients spending $100000 for the treatment and frequently concluding treatment without a successful pregnancy to term. 
I understand this is an elective procedure and there are other reversible contraceptive methods which have similar success rates, such as the IUD, Implant, Depo shot. I am not interested in long acting reversible contraceptives, and want a permanent solution to my fertility. 
I understand that this procedure may require general anaesthetic and a prolonged recovery time. 
I understand the risks of surgery which may include haemorrhage, death, sepsis, localised infection, bowel injury, vascular injury, pelvic inflammation 
I understand that a vasectomy is a viable option for my fiance, however I would prefer to have a tubal ligation myself 
I understand that there is a chance of failure which can occur many years after the procedure. I understand the risk is highest with the use of clips. Therefore I prefer a method which removes the tubes and carries a lower risk of failure. [4]
I understand there is a risk of an ectopic pregnancy which will require surgery to remove the foetal tissue. [5]

"I chose to get my tubes tied (at 23yearsold) over the essure. 1 because I know my body has extreme reactions to almost everything. 2 because I had a slight nickel allergy as a child, that may or may not have gone away. 3 because I keep hearing horror stories about essure. There are plenty of good and bad, but the ""bad"" things were frequent enough/bad enough to cause concern, and the people experiencing those bad things had to have the essure cut out, so basically a tubal anyways. And, by the time I noticed side effects and symptoms, I might not be covered under my parents insurance anymore, and god knows when I'll be in a situation to get my own, so tubal.

The experience? The worst part of it was getting the IV in on surgery day. Apparently healthy veins have lots of valves, which make IVcatheter insertion difficult. Almost passed out on their third try. But once that was in it was smooth sailing. And I was hiking four days later, so not much recovery time. 

Secure in the effectiveness? Yes. I had my tubes cut/burned, so BOOM, super effective. But with the essure they do an ultrasound check after a few months to make sure your tubes are completely blocked, which would give you your security. 

Worth it? Hell-to-the-fuck-yes. 

*I never have to worry about if my birth control isn't working properly (for whatever reason) 

*I never have to worry about forgetting whatever is keeping me from having babies 

*I never have to buy anything to prevent babies, ever again

*I never have to switch/troubleshoot bc methods because my current one started bothering my body 

*I don't have to deal with any of the side effects of hormonal bc 

*I don't have to deal with the inconveniences of physical barrier bc 

Other little wins: If someone tells me I will change my mind or that ""accidents happen"", or what if you meet ""the right man"", or any of those other terrible excuses to reproduce, I can tell them to ""Shove it, I had my insurance pay a lot of people a lot of money to make that an impossibility.""

The probability of a pregnancy occurring anytime within the first 20 years is 0.0052%, or about half of 1% of 1%.

This means 1 couple out of 19,231 using this combined sterilization would have an unexpected pregnancy within twenty years, assuming they all had sex for that long, and would have been fertile for that entire duration if not for the sterilization.

"I don't have essure, I got my tubes tied (burnt actually) laparoscopicly. I researched my options and recommend you do the same, including talking to a doctor. From what I understand Essure has some issues, but it is not surgical. The metal coils are placed and 3 months later are checked. A back up method must be used during that time. The coils cause scarring inside the tubes. There is a (small) chance of the coils moving, perforating the fallopian tubes or other organs, or being expelled which sometimes requires surgery to correct. It is common to have cramping after the coils are placed. The coils have nickle in them, Essure says it is too small to cause a reaction in nickle sensitive/allergic people but my doctor told me otherwise. Essure is currently involved in a class action lawsuit for not accurately describing risks and effectiveness. I was nervous about having surgery for my tubal ligation but honestly it wasn't that bad and they gave me an anxiety med before the surgery. The recovery took only a few days and the most uncomfortable part was bloating and shoulder pain. I don't have to worry about having coils or clips which can be expelled or fail, and the scar is very small. So yeah I didn't get Essure but I did do A LOT of research before I made the decision.

"Those risks are not exaggerated, by any means. Since we're off the topic of pregnancy (which is higher than stated in Essure literature), migration of the coils is a big issue, major inflammation not limited to the reproductive organs, bowel/bladder adhesions, nickel allergies that develop AFTER placement, perforation of organs when the coils migrate, and a host of other life altering issues. 

The coils are made of nickel and coated with PET fibers. PET fibers are not supposed to be used in implantable medical devices. They are an irritant and that irritation does not quit occurring once your tubes are occluded. They affect your hormones, cause auto immune diseases and cause system wide inflammation. 

All of theses adverse reactions? They lead to hysterectomy, and that alone has its own large set of possible complications. 

You asked in another comment if I had an axe to grind. I guess this is my axe. Did your doctor tell you about PET fibers, give you an allergy test, warn you that allergies can develop, or explain what migration of the coils actually means for your body? This is what women need to know if they're going to make an informed decision. There's more to it than ""zero downtime"" and no anesthesia.

I ended up going with the tubal. (We actually tried Essure first but the placement failed so we went with the tubal.)  It wasn't bad at all.  I was in a bit of pain for the first couple of days but it wasn't at the surgical site.  During a laproscopic procedure, they pump you full of gas to give them a little more room to work.  They get most of it out but the remaining bit triggers a nerve just right to cause shoulder pain of all things.  That was the worst part.  It took a couple of days for the gas to completely leave my body and I felt like I had an alien in my belly when I shifted positions.  I had three small incisions that were closed with glue.  I was able to shower normally and was told to just let the glue come off on its own.

I had the procedure on a Tuesday and was back to work with no issues by the following Monday.  I probably could have gone back sooner but I was trying to burn up some vacation time.

I just had to be careful about bending and lifting for a few days.  I went back to barre class after 2 weeks and that was probably a little soon.  I ended up with aggravated ab muscles and hip flexors so take it a little easy on the heavy exercise until you are fully healed.

Mine was fully covered under the ACA so I didn't receive a bill for any of it.  The surgery was totally worth the peace of mind for me as I'm terrified of an accidental pregnancy in a state that is closing clinics as fast as they can.

"Bilateral salpingectomy at 23. This is a full removal of the Fallopian tubes, and it is the only procedure (besides a flat-out hysterectomy) that I would have agreed to, no matter how much more time it took.


It took me about 1 year of talking to doctors and spreading my personal letter around local medical facilities (many of which offered Essure only...nope). I eventually got my surgery from a doc listed in the sidebar, who gave me no trouble (then again, I had my letter and her colleague was there at the consultation, too. Thankfully he was impressed!). 


Actual surgery was pretty smooth. Came in the early morning and was home later that afternoon, with lots of drugs and little pain. I took one day off work, then was slower for about 1 week and 100% fresh in 1.5 weeks. I'm a HUGE walker (4-10 miles/day), so I was trying to push it again on day 2, which may or may not have been wise.


No long-term physical effects to speak of, although there were some weird (ovulation-related? phantom tubish?) twinges inside for a while. They didn't hurt much at all. Sex is fantastic.


One more thing I feel compelled to share is that I _did_ have an unusual amount of anxiety for a few months after, without _ever_ having been on any hormonal birth control before that (in fact, yes - I refused to even lose my virginity before this surgery :P ).

**Now, I do not generally believe in post-tubal ligation syndrome, which seems like an invention of money-hungry reversal clinics and the sexist establishment (""ohhh, you'll be sooo saddddd about losing your puuurpose."" Disgusting and insulting.)**

BUT, this was a very difficult and seemingly chemical bout of mental unhappiness. It was very, very bad anxiety and I felt like a clingier, paranoid, miserable version of myself for hours at a time, 5-6 times per week. I wondered if it was remotely possible that removing the tubes gave a little poke or interruption to my ovaries and their brain-affecting chemicals, which took some time to even out (hence the twinges also?). 

BUT, again, I am no medical professional, and there were MANY confounders. For one thing, I work at a startup, which can be super stressful. For ANOTHER thing, I have always battled disordered eating habits for unrelated reasons, and I had started to eat insufficient lunches again around that time (hungry or even starving = more anxious). For yet ANOTHER thing, I'm in New England and we were starting winter, so it was goddamn cold and dark by 4:30 PM.

I am sorry to ramble, but figure it's best to put it all out there. I, for one, made sure to eat better again and have been doing immensely better (plus summer came). Overall, it was worth it in my case.

"I had it done in May. Here is my (long) story:

I'm 35 and have never been pregnant. I got Essure done in May with the follow up hysterosalpingogram in August. Mine went absolutely perfect as far as the placement of the implants and the healing.

**BEFORE THE CONSULT**

I called my insurance company to make sure that the procedure was covered under their ACA requirements. I located a doctor who was both on their site of in-network physicians and the Essure website and made an appointment for a consult. 

**THE CONSULT**

The doctor talked to me for about 5 minutes about the procedure, confirmed that I did not want children, explained that he would like for me to take a hormone (Aygestin, progesterone hormone) temporarily to prevent buildup of the uterine lining , starting on the 2nd day of my next period. The doctor told me that in less than 5% of nulliparous patients the inserts can't be placed because of the size of the uterus and the tubes, and they don't know until the scope is in there what they're dealing with. He described it as 'trying to plug in a lamp from across the room when the wall is covered in shag carpet.' Showed me what the coils look like. Twenty minutes after I met him, I was scheduling the procedure with the office's surgical coordinator. I was already smiling ear to ear, so when I signed the consent form I did a victory dance. She told me I was 'the happiest patient to be getting sterilized' she had ever seen. Also told me that they've got a lot of women desperate to get pregnant like it is the 'most important thing in the world', which she followed up with 'I've got kids; it's  not.' and telling me how happy she is about her own tubal.

The next date that they had available was 34 days later, so that's the one I took. I had my procedure done at the surgical center (due to insurance). No food or drink after midnight the night before. I had to get presurgical blood work, which just meant stopping at the hospital lab within 7 days of the procedure for them to draw some blood. Make sure I wasn't pregnant or dying. 

**Procedure Day** 

Arrived early for my appointment (7am), got all changed into the hospital gown (put all my stuff into a big white bag that said PATIENT BELONGINGS) and had IV saline. They gave me some Toradol (NSAID) for pain relief and cramping. They tagged me with my ID band and my ALLERGY band. The place was super busy that day, so I had a screaming kid in the prep area next to mine. He kept running around and looking in other people's curtains. Because things were busy, the doctor didn't come to see me until 45 minutes after my original procedure time. By then the kid had been wailing like an air raid siren for over 90 minutes. Doctor very loudly asked me 'Are you sure you don't want any babies?' 

'I am 150% pope-is-catholic-bears-shit-in-the-woods positively certain I never want one of **those**.' I confirmed my drug allergy again. He said we were all set and the anesthesiologist would come talk to me to ask all the anesthesia related questions. He came in and introduced himself. He asked about smoking, drinking, breathing problems, throat problems, fillings, jaw problems, snoring and dental work. I had to say again what medications I'm allergic to.

Then we went to the procedure room right around 10. I carried my PATIENT BELONGINGS which seemed to surprise the nurse lady. I looked up at the whiteboard and it had my name on it, and ESSURE in big letters. I got up on the table and they strapped in my arms for the IV stuff before giving me the conscious sedation. I'm one of those people who gets all paranoid about missing the alarm clock for early morning important stuff, so I hadn't really slept the night before. Like a baby, actually, I woke up every hour. They kept putting warm blankets on me and I told them I was hot enough already. So I took what I would call a nap because I was aware of time passing and responding to some things that they asked me to do like move this way or that way, and then they asked me to slide over onto the rolling bed to go to recovery. I asked them to make sure they brought my 'suitcase' of PATIENT BELONGINGS. From the time they gave me the sedative until I looked at the clock in recovery, 45 minutes elapsed. 

In recovery, right away I took off my oxygen mask and put my ponytail holder back in. I ditched the hot blanket because I'm not a chestnut and don't need to be roasted. A nurse came over and said 'Wow you are like instant-on. Not groggy at all.' I said 'I want a black coffee and a bathroom.' They made me wait 10 minutes but then they let me get up and go to a chair where they took my IV out and gave me coffee. My interpretation of 'stand up slowly' was to pretty much leap off the bed. I was rocking the hospital gown, hospital robe and underwear ensemble, and toting my PATIENT BELONGINGS. Still hadn't let me pee or brought me coffee. They explained my discharge instructions, which were not being allowed to drive for 24 hours. I was given a prescription for 600 mg Motrin and a little card for Essure that says I have medical implants. They do not set off metal detectors. They wanted me to sit in this chair and drink my coffee slowly. I'm a software engineer, so that little cup of coffee went down like a shot. They took my IV out and I got dressed.  So the nurse came over and offered me some toast. I told her that I was going to go out to the car and have my driver take me to the nearest bacon-servering establishment. She said she would walk me out to the waiting room and I said 'But I'm going to make a pit stop at your restroom first.' I got a lot of comments about how I appeared as if nothing at all had even been done to me, and that if they didn't know better they would swear I'd had no anesthesia at all.

Driver took me to the pharmacy where I picked up the Motrin, and then we went out to a diner for breakfast before coming home. I had to yell 'RED LIGHT! MIGHT WANNA STOP!' at my sober driver (probably should've taken the keys myself) on the way to breakfast. I did indeed order my breakfast special (waffle, bacon and eggs) with an extra side of bacon! My driver deposited me at my house, went home and I was back to feeling normal by then. I had a couple of hours of light period like bleeding, but no pain.

**Followup**

One month later I went to the followup where the doctor discussed the procedure and asked if I had any questions, which I didn't, and we scheduled the date for when he will do the HSG test. I gave him the happy dance again. He asked how I felt and I told him 'Awesome as always.' 

**The Confirmation Test (HSG)**

Day before, go to the hospital and get blood work. They're testing for pregnancy, which of course, is negative. Show up at the hospital for the HSG test, wait for doctor to arrive. After he got there, I put on the wonderful hospital gown (only from the waist down, yay) and went into the X-ray room. Assume the position, much like a regular gyno visit, and get the speculum treatment. Then the doctor gives a shot in the cervix, and puts the catheter in. It felt like a pinch and a mild cramp when the balloon was inflated. The radiologist and the nurse are in their bunker at my head end and I get all filled up with contrast while watching the computer monitor showing my innards. After five or so minutes of roll this way, roll that way, scoot up, scoot down they're done with the X-ray machine and the equipment comes out so we can go over the results. The scars are formed and I'm 100% blocked. I fist pump. In typical hospital fashion, they make a big deal about sitting up and such, so I have to wait fifteen minutes and a blood pressure reading before going home. Sterilization successful. 

So far (this us US info) my costs have been:

40$ copay for the initial office visit

40$ copay for the day of surguery

40$ copay for the HSG

10$ for the Aygestin (generic substitute)

3$ for the Motrin (generic substitute)

1 day of PTO for procedure, leaving work early one day for the consult, and one lunchtime followup.

"Essure was a procedure for permanent sterilization.  It was an outpatient procedure, where they go in through your cervix and implant a small coil in each of your fallopian tubes.  Your body then forms scar tissue, so sperm can't meet egg.

It was developed by Conceptus in maybe 2006? and I had it done in 2008.  Conceptus had great quality control - they sent a tech to my doctor's office to observe the procedure.  Then, Bayer bought Conceptus and quality control went straight out the window.  Soon, women were experiencing ectopic pregnancies, the coils were piercing their tubes, there was a lawsuit, and Bayer pulled the product.

"On the other hand, I *love* my IUD. Though I think when I get it replaced, I will get the hormonal IUD, since I know a lot more about it now, and I don't think I need to be afraid of the effect of the hormones on my body.

In the past, I have used the Pill, and natural family planning (aka sympto-thermal method) combined with condoms. I like that the IUD doesn't mess with my hormones (the pill made me depressed, lowered my sex drive, made me more prone to catching colds, and it was annoying to constantly have to buy more), and NFP meant that I couldn't have unprotected sex when I was at my most libidinous (and condoms really suck!). The copper IUD makes my periods more painful and heavier, but it's not as bad as it used to be, and I really like the ""set it and forget it"" nature of it. I just periodically feel for the string to make sure it's in place. 

Unlike having to take a pill every day, or having to wake up at the same time every day to take my temperature (and then daily check my cervix), and then account for the biological effects of drinking or being tired or sick...  Every birth control method has downsides, but I think that for me, the IUD is the best method I've tried.

"Sure, but not wanting to get pregnant is the woman's choice. The doctor is not forcing birth control onto them.

That link is quite interesting, and it may even prove your point. Here's a problem I see with that though. It's all based on self reporting, there's no way to objectively measure regret. People aren't generally keen on admitting they've made mistakes. They're also very good at adapting to different circumstances out of necessity. 

I did read their reasoning. Did you miss the part where I actually agree with you on this issue? My point is that disagreeing is not necessarily wrong, and it's certainly not some sort of conspiracy to harm people, or force them to pay to birth a baby. This is not a black and white issue.

Feel free to correct me on this, because my knowledge of female contraception isn't what it once was (long term partner has no uterus). My understanding is that tubals are still by far the most common method. Ablation isn't widely performed, and the availability of Essure is limited.

That means that when deciding which partner should be sterilized, they're weighing tubal vs. vasectomy. They're simply advising the least invasive and dangerous method of sterilization.

The scientific community chooses which evidence it will take into account all the time. There are doctors ignoring the efficacy of cannabis treatments, for example. If you mention the correlation between race and IQ, you're likely to be blackballed in Academia, etc. It's dishonest to claim that they don't pick and choose which evidence they'll pay attention to.",childfree,2016-05-04 13:38:13,sure wanting pregnant woman choice doctor forcing birth control onto link interesting may even prove point problem see though based self reporting way objectively measure regret people generally keen admitting made mistake also good adapting different circumstance necessity read reasoning miss part actually agree issue point disagreeing necessarily wrong certainly sort conspiracy harm people force pay birth baby black white issue feel free correct knowledge female contraception long term partner uterus understanding tubals still far common method ablation widely performed availability limited mean deciding partner sterilized weighing tubal vasectomy simply advising least invasive dangerous method sterilization scientific community chooses evidence take account time doctor ignoring efficacy cannabis treatment example mention correlation race iq likely blackballed academia etc dishonest claim pick choose evidence pay attention
"I might be the minority here, but I have Essure and I think it was the best choice for me. Most insurance plans don't cover a salpingectomy, only Essure or traditional tubal ligation.

My suggestion would be (if you go this route) is to find a doctor who is very familiar with the procedure and has performed it several times, and to be tested for nickel allergy beforehand. I was lucky enough to find a provider who offered IV sedation during the procedure, as my previous IUD insertion didn't go so smoothly.

&gt;__Essure__ is a permanent, non-surgical [transcervical sterilization](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcervical_sterilization) procedure for women developed by [Conceptus Inc.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptus_Inc.) It was approved for use in the United States on November 4, 2002. 

&gt;Two economic studies, one of which implemented Essure as an in-office procedure, suggest that Essure could be more cost-effective than [laparoscopic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscope) bilateral [tubal ligation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tubal_ligation).

"Well.. that was awkward. 

OK, let me begin by admitting I am a horrible person.
When I walked into the office, I saw a male doctor who was clearly muslim. Now, let me be very clear: I have nothing agains anyone on the basis if their religion. Everyone must believe what they believe, as long as it doesn't interfere with my personal life and life choices. So... well... 'Perfect', I thought..

I explained a bit about my other complaints and that I am seeing a doctor at the hospital tomorrow since I checked into A&amp;E last night, so that there wasn't anything really he could do for that (but I had already booked the appointment), but, that there was something else I'd liked to discuss: Getting an Essure.

He never heard of it.

And I had to explain what it was. While he googled. (no I kid you not)

When he sort of knew what it was the questions came, but I predicted that. So I answered them, told them 'our' story, that we are both sure, wouldn't have married each other if one of us had doubts, wouldn't want to compromise on that, threw in a 

""to be fair I think we have put a lot more thought into this than a lot of people who do actually have a child and can decide to do this no matter what""

And then he said...

""I'd be happy to refer you, I'll go figure out where and whether we offer this in the vincinity. If not, would a ligation would be an option too?""

And I was just flabbergasted! :D 

Just before I left he called me back and asked me one more question, whether my husband would want a vasectomy. I said: yes, but I still want to go through with this myself as well, because it is also my choice, and it is a choice I actively want to make for me, regardless of whether for some reason our marriage comes to an end, which I do not think it will ;)

So, yes, he did tell me to prepare for more questions after the referral, but.... first step not too shabby! :D",childfree,2015-02-03 16:17:51,well awkward ok let begin admitting horrible person walked office saw male doctor clearly muslim let clear nothing agains anyone basis religion everyone must believe believe long interfere personal life life choice well thought explained bit complaint seeing doctor hospital tomorrow since checked amp e last night anything really already booked appointment something else liked discus never heard explain googled kid sort knew question came predicted answered told story sure married one u doubt want compromise threw fair think put lot thought lot people actually child decide matter said happy refer figure whether offer vincinity ligation option flabbergasted left called back asked one question whether husband want vasectomy said yes still want well also choice choice actively want regardless whether reason marriage come end think yes tell prepare question referral first step shabby

"As a childfree woman the survey isnât helpful at all. If you want my story: 

I was late 20s, married, no kids and I wanted to find a more permanent birth control method. So I started researching what the procedure ""tying your tubes"" entailed / read a ton of experiences after my Paragard partially expelled at one year.   

I decided on a tubal ligation with Filshie clips. It has the best effective rate I could find (lifetime average effective rate of 99.75% see: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16259814 or http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/24560346/?i=1&amp;amp;amp;amp;from=filshie%20clips)

So I scheduled an appointment with my OBGYN, she is on the younger side and very openminded (there is a link in the sidebar to open minded doctors if you don't have a open minded OBGYN). We had a 30 minute conversation and she agreed that I was well researched / she was comfortable I understood it was permanent. After the consult, I discussed with her scheduling nurse when I would prefer to schedule it (it was around 3 months out). 

Cost: During my research, I triple checked the ACA law required the insurance to 100% cover it. I paid about $10 for the at home pain pills. So in *total* it cost me only $10.00! Check out www.coverher.org for info about that! 

Pre-Op:

Since it was scheduled 3 months after the consult the hospital required my doctor to do a Pre-Op with me. So week of procedure I had a Pre-Op apt with my Doctor. Basically just a quick check of everything. I asked whether I needed a catheter and she doubted I would. She gave no restrictions as to sex or exercise and just resume when comfortable. Got my pain prescriptions and pre-filled them so I could go straight home after my tubal ligation. Definitely ask to get them pre-filled. 

Procedure: 

It was scheduled for 8:00 am on Friday. Hospital told me to check in at 6-6:15 am for paperwork / prep. Paperwork was just double checking everything (copy of insurance card / etc). Walked to a private mini hospital room and Nurse started intake / asking health questions (when did I eat last, what medications/ etc) and changed into the hospital gown and signed my sterilization consent form. Doctor also stopped by to chat before. I told the anesthesiologist that I get nauseous under general anesthesia so they put a patch behind my ear to help. Then one of the nurses gave me an IV (they numb the area first). I peed right before so I wouldnât need a catheter (and I didnât). The nurse then put blue leg warmers on my legs to help prevent blood clots (this is normal for any procedure). Around 8:00 am the anesthesiologist came and gave me valium through the IV. Later I was then rolled into the OR. I don't even really remember leaving the room - they have some good drugs :)

Post-OP:
I woke up wide awake in the recovery area. The patch worked so I was not nauseous. The nurse asked my pain scale and I was at a 3/10. It was basically a bad period cramp type of feeling, but no real âpainâ per se. The doctor came back and told me everything was normal and that the actual procedure took 15 minutes. She made the first incision into my belly button (but because she was so awesome no scar there). The second small incision is below my bikini line. She then went to talk to my husband to give him the details and tell him after care instructions. 

After 30 minutes or so I was moved into the big recovery area. The nurse brought me food and juice. My husband came in and was really surprised how awake and normal I was. After 30 minutes of being in the big recovery area, I got dressed by myself and left. We left around 10:00 am. 

Tips: Wear loose fitting PJs and a thin maxi pad. Bring a bottle of water to drink after as your throat is sore. Have a pillow in the car for the seat belt. 

At-Home Recovery:

Friday: 
I went home and slept. I could walk around fine, I was just tired. I walked up the stairs to my bedroom by myself. My tummy was a tiny bit inflated by the gas they use to see what they are doing in there, but nothing crazy, it just looked like I had eaten a big meal / slight bloat. 
The pain pills made me more tired so I just slept the rest of the day. I ate lunch and dinner normally. 

Saturday and Sunday: 
The rest of the weekend, I just watched TV with my husband. I could do stuff, I just chose to relax. Basically it was just a lazy weekend. Have some good movies and shows to watch. I was sore, but just like too many sit-ups sore. I could have done errands if I needed to, but with the pain pills you aren't suppose to drive.

Monday:
I went back to work on Monday. No prescription pain pills and just did over the counter stuff Monday and Tuesday. No one even guessed anything :) The worst thing was really from the IV (big bruise as my veins hate IVs) but just wore long sleeve shirts for a few days.

Summary: It was way simpler and easier than I thought! I have one tiny 1/2 inch scar below my bikini line that faded. The tubal ligation was the best thing I ever did! 

P.S. Don't fall for the fake ""Post Tubal ligation Syndrome."" The 'doctor' that created it, lost her license (http://www.casewatch.org/board/med/hufnagel/order_2004.shtml or http://caselaw.findlaw.com/ca-court-of-appeal/1230512.html) for being crazy.

Neither a tubal ligation (tubes tied), bilateral salpingectomy (tube removal), nor Essure (blocking your tubes) will effect your hormones. Women usually stop hormonal birth control when they get their tubes tied. As in they return to their natural period. Hormonal birth stops your cycle so you neither ovulate nor have a period so when you are on it you have a lighter fake bleed. Correlation is NOT causation.

Some of the research disproving the fake syndrome - they didn't even find correlation, let alone causation:

"None of that is true. 

I have factor V Leiden too and currently have a copper IUD. Do you know if they will offer you anticoagulant drugs before and after surgery, if you're not currently taking them every day? I'm a little afraid of the risk of clots from surgery so I was thinking of going with Essure later down the line, but I've read of coils falling out, going on vacation in the body, women being allergic to them... Same complaints as with an IUD I guess which I have no problems with so maybe it's not as bad as people make it out to be.

I have to hand it to the women who intentionally get pregnant despite the FVL because Lord knows I'm not playing with fire like that.

"Thankfully I have a wonderful mother. When I first got on the pill as a teenager, I came home and she looks at me and goes ""If you don't take the sugar pills you never have to have a period."" and walked away. Aside from the past 6 months where I was on Sprintec and my body fucking hated it, I've had maybe 3 periods since then. 

My GP was the best though. I asked him about prescribing me BC since I was going to PP and the nurse I got the time prior had looked at my chart and gone ""I don't *believe* in taking birth control that way so you're going to have to have a period like the rest of us."" Then immediately called the pharmacy to update my script before I left the office, canceling my last refill. I told my GP, he goes ""she's a fucking idiot"" then asked what I would do if I were pregnant at that moment. I asked if he had a coat metal hanger laying around. He laughed and we've been friends ever since. I have one more year before he'll refer me for some sort of sterilization because he wanted me to wait 3 years since he felt it would be irresponsible on his behalf to not be sure I was okay with that choice and the ""repercussions"" since I was 24 at the time.

"1. Never, EVER treat surgery as easy or even reversible! Married people don't need to cut each other open or put each other under carefully controlled anaesthetic to get a divorce. Reversing a surgery like a clipping would require another surgery, just to remove the clips.

2. You can choose any one you want, pretty much all of them permanently alter or damage the uterine anatomy in some way. I've yet to find a single form of sterilization that *doesn't* involve some form of tube sealing. That's probably because using chemicals to sterilize introduces a new set of problems that physical sterilization don't need to address. In any case, my point still stands: most forms of sterilization are either surgical, or a permanent rewiring of uterine anatomy. Neither would be desirable to deal with should a complication arise.

3. Despite this, Essure [is still being sold in the United States, albeit with some extra disclaimers.](https://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm488313.htm) Even the FDA can't prove the symptoms are caused by Essure. They've ordered investigations into the symptoms, but so far, they've got nothing.

By the way, I should warn you that just because something is ""known for its complications"" does not mean doctors won't use it. SSRIs, the first-line medical treatment in depression, are famously known to actually make depression *worse* for the first two weeks, to the point that it can give you suicidal thoughts. (In fact, you can even find [a whole website filled with stories](https://ssristories.org/) of those who, rather unfortunately, acted on them.) Now, by no means am I saying that we're going to give this to every sad patient that turns up on our doorstep - but remember that medicine is about benefits versus risk, and that doctors will give different ""best"" answers based on the patient, their experience, and the resources at their disposal.

4. Of course they ask that. People ask that because, at its core, it's a very easy question. People like easy questions.

You might think that's not a satisfactory answer, or that it's not complex enough to be useful, but that's simply the truth of it. Picture this; you know someone who smokes a lot, and has for several years, to the point that you know it has already affected (to a certain extent) his current lung function. Now, which is easier: sitting down with them and outline at length all the possible (and guaranteed) side effects of smoking he has and will have if he continues? Or, simply saying: ""It's bad for you""?

It's not that people are ignorant, it's just that people are lazy. I can't speak for you, but I'd imagine most people don't want to sit through or give an entire lecture detailing the benefits and risks of an arguably controversial elective surgery to their friends, so instead, they look for something a lot easier to ask, and go, ""What if you change your mind?"" It's an easy question that establishes the permanence of the operation, and - without having to go into detail - implies the potential complications of said future operation, in one concise sentence. It ticks all their boxes, so they use it.

I can see how you would see that as disrespectful. I wouldn't want my operation to be seen as nothing more than small talk. But to be honest, regular people wouldn't be the only ones guilty of being lazy. Entire healthcare professions have restructured how they counsel patients based on this principle alone. Giving out information sheets for a drug or a procedure doesn't make doctors or clinicians ignorant to a patient's plight, or less informative to them (they'll still have to counsel on a treatment's major risks anyway no matter what). The information leaflet just helps fill in the gaps and save time for all the things the doctor won't or can't say. Anyway, my point is: people ask because they are lazy, but I wouldn't think of them as lazy any more than I would think that they all are the same.

5. Whatever the case may be, the OP's choice, reasons and/or motivation behind sterilization, are entirely hers. In fact, you could argue she doesn't even need a reason to do it at all, though I am sure she does have one.

In any case, concerns and such aside, the otherwise ignorance of others should not have any bearing on your own choices and vice versa.

"Vasectomies are safer too, both in terms of effectiveness and possible complications. I don't have data but I wouldn't be surprised if vasectomies were much more common because of those and for cultural reasons (i.e. doctors, like other people assuming that all women will eventually want babies, and trusting a man's word but not a woman's, when they're saying they don't ever want kids).

Thankfully tubal and the pill aren't the only option, of course. Have you looked into Essure (if it's not a medical reason for the tubal as well)? IUD?

"You are right to be wary of tubal ligation - it is a major, invasive procedure that takes a long time to heal fully.  Essure is a bit safer, but you may have difficulty getting a doctor to do a permanent procedure like that, given your age.

I personally love my Mirena IUD - it's good for 5 years and has the added benefit of reducing/eliminating your periods.  The copper IUD is even longer-lasting, at 12 years, and it's non-hormonal which can be nice if you react to hormones.  One downside is that it can worsen PMS symptoms and make your periods heavier.  The procedure to insert the IUD only takes about 20 minutes and, for me at least, just involved moderate cramping during the procedure and for the next 12 hours or so.  I was totally fine 24 hours later.

Implanon is another option, though I've known a couple of people who've had it reject (your body literally pushes it out).",childfree,2013-06-18 18:25:04,right wary tubal ligation major invasive procedure take long time heal fully bit safer may difficulty doctor permanent procedure like given age personally love mirena iud good year added benefit period copper iud even year nice react hormone one downside worsen pm symptom period heavier procedure insert iud take minute least involved moderate cramping procedure next hour totally fine hour later implanon another option though known couple people reject body literally push

"I've had one! I had Essure and an ablation last May. I was knocked out for the procedure, and I had pretty intense pain once the drugs wore off. My fiance got me the painkillers the doctor prescribed and once those kicked in, I was good. I had pain on and off for about a week where I used the stronger painkillers, but then I was able to switch to basic Advil. I'd have random twinges of sharp pain every so often for a couple weeks but I went back to my regular routine after like two days. (I even went on a road trip about four days after the surgery.) 

I would absolutely recommend the ablation. I basically cauterizes the inside of your uterus, and while it is possible the lining can grow back for some people it usually doesn't. I was on Seasonalle for like 8 years before getting my Essure so they was no chance in hell I was going back to a monthly period. I wouldn't have gotten one without the other.

He said he didn't like the idea of making the permanent decision to NOT have kids, via my sterilization (uh, hello, having kids is a permanent decision), because he doesn't know what the future may hold. He said he may want kids in his early 30s. He's turning 29 this year. Regardless of whether I get sterilized or not, falling pregnant and having a child will NEVER be an option I want to pursue. After that, it just seemed silly to continue our relationship, knowing that we have such different plans for our futures, and I may deprive him of something he wants. I still love him, and plan to keep him in my life, but building a life and relationship with someone who has completely different plans than yourself is a waste of time, in my opinion.",childfree,2013-02-26 01:54:27,wow actually went past weekend together two year live together secretive like talk much relationship future always laughed together awful kid seems assumed childfree well finally found doctor perform tubal got really weird apparently even though know logically kid poor investment huge risk still nurture biological desire said like idea making permanent decision kid via sterilization uh hello kid permanent decision know future may hold said may want kid early turning year regardless whether sterilized falling pregnant child never option want pursue seemed silly continue relationship knowing different plan future may deprive something want still love plan keep life building life relationship someone completely different plan waste time opinion

"I hope the resources have been good to you! If you're unlucky, the worst-case scenario is an IUD for a few years until your current gynecologist or a new one takes you more seriously. The best-case scenario is the tubal ligation, an Essure procedure, or an ablation. 

I would guess salpingectomies to be much harder to acquire, as they're usually done because of infection, ectopic pregnancy, or cancer. 

Though not true in every case, as many of our CF women are happily sans uterus and in good health, if you think of your pelvis as a house then the uterus is the foundation and the walls. Taking it out increases your chance of prolapse, amongst other things.

Best wishes going forward!

"Have you tried talking to gynecologists yet? 

I think you might be surprised. I'm 27, unmarried and childless and am getting sterilized next week! I told my gyno that I've always wanted this, but I assumed no one would agree to do it for me. 

He told me that it wasn't an issue for him because I had thought out the procedure carefully, was sure (there was no ""maybe"" about it for me), and other birth control didn't work out (hormonal birth control aggravates my depression, copper IUD is too painful, condoms are great but not super reliable).

The fact that you already have a daughter works in your favor-- you know what the deal is so you're more than qualified to know that she's enough to complete your family. 

I'm sorry your husband isn't totally on board. I think it might be worth it to see a marriage counselor. It's totally within your rights to stop at one kid, but you all could benefit from talking it out formally. He might be pretty bummed about never having another bio-kid again and therapy could help him come to terms with that. That being said, there is absolutely no legal requirement for a husband to consent to this procedure for you. 

I wouldn't worry about your family. Adult children get all sorts of pressure from their parents trying to micromanage their lives. It's annoying, but that's it. Your mother can sulk if you get ""fixed,"" but it's your life not hers, and you don't ""owe"" her a dozen grandchildren.

I would recommend looking into the Essure procedure or hygroscopic sterilization. The surgeon goes in through your vagina and cervix and places metal coils in your fallopian tubes. After three months scar tissue builds up around them, sealing the egg highway to your uterus for good. The procedure involves no cutting, no scars, minimal pain, and a 1 day recovery (as oppose to about a week for traditional tubals). http://www.essure.com/

"I am having the same experience with my four year old ablation! Just saw my gyn about it today, wound up in the ER as well (they said I was constipated lol). I have been in 9/10 pain for several hours a day, 3-7 days for the last two months, and the pain had been escalating for almost a year now, with me mostly ignoring it cause I was used to painful periods for so long. But yeah, Iâve been so bad I become incoherent, never felt anything like it. 33 years old. Will be having a hysterectomy at some point soon. Luckily my gyn surgeon is amazing. 

Anyway, not everyone with an ablation gets this, of course, but OP, just know itâs possible, and if you do an ablation and get symptoms, youâre not going crazy! Go get it checked out. 

I also had a laparoscopic salpingectomy (tube removal) at the same time as the ablation. Thatâs been great! I did that because Iâd tried Essure three years before, and had awful period cramps from it. Again, kind of ignored it when I should have pursued it with my gyn. 

The implants are permanent, so we had to remove my tubes to get them out. Which I was fine with, I wanted that over Essure to begin with, but decided to go less invasive. 

To answer your bullet points:

-Recovery was pretty simple for my ablation/tube removal. I felt like shit the first day, the nurse was a bitch when I woke up (though the pre surgery nurses were all absolutely amazing), so that set me off into an anesthesia fueled emotional episode. I just felt whiny and overwhelmed. Second day much better, Norco was my friend. Third day I overdid it (cause Norco), felt super sore and tired the day after. But if you clean the house first, make sure youâve got easy food to eat on hand (prep a bunch of healthy but comforting food), and keep up with pain meds, naps, and gentle walking around, itâs probably going to go well!

-Approved with insurance or doctor? I had Medicaid and they didnât really care. I also got lucky to find an awesome doctor who made sure itâs what I wanted, but never shamed me for my desires. r/childfree has a wiki where people post childfree friendly docs they have encountered. 

-No regerts, except Iâd have skipped the ablation, but it was a known risk. 

-Only negative effects detailed above. 

-Can absolutely do tubal/ablation at the same time. Might as well! You can also just have your tubes removed instead of tied. Brief advantages: 100% no eggs making it through the void to get fertilized. May prevent ovarian cancer (some research shows some originates in the fallopian tubes). 

- I did not have anyone oppose my decision. 

Apologies for the somewhat staccato writing, I just wanted to bang out these answers. I had a lot of the same questions as you, and I read a lot of experience stories on Reddit actually.

edited to add: if youve never had anesthesia before, just be aware you might feel really crazy for a couple of days. Highlight of my last surgery, me shouting at my boyfriend, âIâm not mad, I just keep yelling at you!â then breaking down in tears. I was just extremely irritable and short tempered, with basically no ability to keep it in check like a freaking adult.

"There's been a lot of negativity around essure and I wouldn't recommend it. Surgical sterilization is more effective and has fewer complications. Afaik essure is getting sued for some issue.

Surgical sterilization can be a tubal ligation, or, even more effectively, tubal removal (bilateral salpingectomy) which leaves your ovaries and uterus intact. No negative effects besides the risk associated with any general anesthetic procedure. Will not stop your periods.

The ONLY way to stop periods is through hormones, or less reliably, endometrial ablation. But ablations may only stop the blood, not any other symptoms (cramping, diarrhea, PMs, etc).

Hysterectomy obviously will stop periods but that's a major surgery more intended for people with serious physical issues, and will affect your hormones, sexual experience, etc. Which may suit your needs!

What should have been an easy procedure was botched because I woke up and was held down after begging them to stop because of how much it hurt.

Over 1700 hysterectomies performed for removal in one year.   They are made from PET fibers and nickel.  Nickel is a common allergen in women and people can become allergic after prolonged exposure.  There is a huge rate of coil migration.  Which happened to me.  It pierced my fallopian tube and migrated and the doctors aren't sure where it is.  It affects your teeth, your hair, your lady parts.

"WTF. Find another clinic. Don't get Essure. The doctor who sterilised me said they are very careful with it these days (and I later heard from my MIL that they have put it on hold completely now) because there are stories popping up of women having quite severe side effects (potentially because of nickle allergy, but they're investigating now). It's on our government's list of medical procedures under investigation, too.

Weirdly, I had another doctor recommend it to me too, probably because it doesn't require invasive surgery. I told him about what I'd read, and he just said 'oh no, that's just in America', like people there somehow react differently to the same thing? I didn't trust that doctor at all, and he rejected me too so that was that. 

So anyway, find a doctor you trust and don't get any procedure you're not comfortable with, even if it's the only thing they'll offer.

I had my tubes removed, which is exactly what I wanted because it's the safest thing out there regarding pregnancy prevention and helps prevent ovarian cancer as well (which often starts in the fallopian tube).

"This is a copy and paste, so ignore what doesnât apply and ask any questions:


I was late 20s, married, no kids and I wanted to find a more permanent birth control method. So I started researching what the procedure ""tying your tubes"" entailed / read a ton of experiences after my Paragard partially expelled at one year.   

I decided on a tubal ligation with Filshie clips. It has the best effective rate I could find (lifetime average effective rate of 99.75% see: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16259814 or http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/24560346/?i=1&amp;amp;amp;amp;from=filshie%20clips)

So I scheduled an appointment with my OBGYN, she is on the younger side and very openminded (there is a link in the sidebar to open minded doctors if you don't have a open minded OBGYN). We had a 30 minute conversation and she agreed that I was well researched / she was comfortable I understood it was permanent. After the consult, I discussed with her scheduling nurse when I would prefer to schedule it (it was around 3 months out). 

Cost: During my research, I triple checked the ACA law required the insurance to 100% cover it. I paid about $10 for the at home pain pills. So in *total* it cost me only $10.00! Check out www.coverher.org for info about that! 

Pre-Op:

Since it was scheduled 3 months after the consult the hospital required my doctor to do a Pre-Op with me. So week of procedure I had a Pre-Op apt with my Doctor. Basically just a quick check of everything. I asked whether I needed a catheter and she doubted I would. She gave no restrictions as to sex or exercise and just resume when comfortable. Got my pain prescriptions and pre-filled them so I could go straight home after my tubal ligation. Definitely ask to get them pre-filled. 

Procedure: 

It was scheduled for 8:00 am on Friday. Hospital told me to check in at 6-6:15 am for paperwork / prep. Paperwork was just double checking everything (copy of insurance card / etc). Walked to a private mini hospital room and Nurse started intake / asking health questions (when did I eat last, what medications/ etc) and changed into the hospital gown and signed my sterilization consent form. Doctor also stopped by to chat before. I told the anesthesiologist that I get nauseous under general anesthesia so they put a patch behind my ear to help. Then one of the nurses gave me an IV (they numb the area first). I peed right before so I wouldnât need a catheter (and I didnât). The nurse then put blue leg warmers on my legs to help prevent blood clots (this is normal for any procedure). Around 8:00 am the anesthesiologist came and gave me valium through the IV. Later I was then rolled into the OR. I don't even really remember leaving the room - they have some good drugs :)

Post-OP:
I woke up wide awake in the recovery area. The patch worked so I was not nauseous. The nurse asked my pain scale and I was at a 3/10. It was basically a bad period cramp type of feeling, but no real âpainâ per se. The doctor came back and told me everything was normal and that the actual procedure took 15 minutes. She made the first incision into my belly button (but because she was so awesome no scar there). The second small incision is below my bikini line. She then went to talk to my husband to give him the details and tell him after care instructions. 

After 30 minutes or so I was moved into the big recovery area. The nurse brought me food and juice. My husband came in and was really surprised how awake and normal I was. After 30 minutes of being in the big recovery area, I got dressed by myself and left. We left around 10:00 am. 

Tips: Wear loose fitting PJs and a thin maxi pad. Bring a bottle of water to drink after as your throat is sore. Have a pillow in the car for the seat belt. 

At-Home Recovery:

Friday: 
I went home and slept. I could walk around fine, I was just tired. I walked up the stairs to my bedroom by myself. My tummy was a tiny bit inflated by the gas they use to see what they are doing in there, but nothing crazy, it just looked like I had eaten a big meal / slight bloat. 
The pain pills made me more tired so I just slept the rest of the day. I ate lunch and dinner normally. 

Saturday and Sunday: 
The rest of the weekend, I just watched TV with my husband. I could do stuff, I just chose to relax. Basically it was just a lazy weekend. Have some good movies and shows to watch. I was sore, but just like too many sit-ups sore. I could have done errands if I needed to, but with the pain pills you aren't suppose to drive.

Monday:
I went back to work on Monday. No prescription pain pills and just did over the counter stuff Monday and Tuesday. No one even guessed anything :) The worst thing was really from the IV (big bruise as my veins hate IVs) but just wore long sleeve shirts for a few days. 

Tips: Heating pad for tummy and Popsicles for your throat. 

Summary: It was way simpler and easier than I thought! I have one tiny 1/2 inch scar below my bikini line that faded. The tubal ligation was the best thing I ever did! 

P.S. Don't fall for the fake ""Post Tubal ligation Syndrome."" The 'doctor' that created it, lost her license (http://www.casewatch.org/board/med/hufnagel/order_2004.shtml or http://caselaw.findlaw.com/ca-court-of-appeal/1230512.html) for being crazy.

Neither a tubal ligation (tubes tied), bilateral salpingectomy (tube removal), nor Essure (blocking your tubes) will effect your hormones. Women usually stop hormonal birth control when they get their tubes tied. As in they return to their natural period. Hormonal birth stops your cycle so you neither ovulate nor have a period so when you are on it you have a lighter fake bleed. Correlation is NOT causation.

Some of the research disproving the fake syndrome - they didn't even find correlation, let alone causation:

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15865627

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23071889

Why? Because it can't /won't restrict the blood flow after surgery. This explains it quite well:

Also studies is on regret for childfree friends :) 

&gt;For women aged 30 or younger at sterilization, the cumulative probability of regret decreased as time since the birth of the youngest child increased (2-3 years, 16.2%, 95% CI 11.4, 21.0; 4-7 years, 11.3%, 95% CI 7.8, 14.8; 8 or more years, 8.3%, 95% CI 5.1, 11.4) **and was lowest among women who had no previous births (6.3%, 95% CI 3.1, 9.4).**

Also

&gt; There did not appear to be a significantly higher rate of regret in nulliparous women undergoing tubal ligation than that seen in studies of parous women.

Unlike you, I didn't have a family member who would take my side.

I only waited another month before I couldn't stay on the BC anymore.  My depression was starting to get worse, it wasn't worth my mental health. I have just under 2 more month before I get my confirmation test for the Essure, so my SO and I are using Condoms and being super SUPER careful.  (I also have a latex allergy, so we can't use normal condoms, which sucks even more) 

I feel 100 times better.  My sex drive is back, the constant state of PMS is gone, I'm starting to slowly lose some weight and I'm just generally happier.

"&gt; 2) It's a fairly new procedure.

I work in the biomedical device field. Essure came out in 2002, by many if not all measures, it is neither a new procedure or a new device being fourteen years old. That is what makes me concerned that at this point in time continued stories and FDA complaints/warnings are coming to light. These should have worked themselves out by now. 

I will yield is that for both essure and a tubal, there is a component to be taken into account regarding the skill of the surgeon. That said, under no circumstance would I ever get an Essure device.

"I might get it after I turn 25, my gyn wasn't opposed to it and is willing to refer me to a clinic that does it, once I'm 25. Where I live there's a law(?) that says everyone over the age of 25 can get sterilized if they want to, or under the age of 25 if there are strong medical reasons to do it (for example having a condition where getting pregnant could kill you, mental health problems, etc). So it doesn't look like it will be a problem for me, but I'm in Norway and got lucky with my gyn. I seriously hope she's still in business after my 25th birthday. 

Edit: I must add that I went really prepared. Some people suggest to take a binder with info you've collects, which I didn't do because waste of paper, but I did mention I had thought about it for a long time, that I know of the alternatives but don't feel comfortable with them, why I want to quit the pill (I often forget about it, have been on it for 8 years which I find too much, my pharmacist has also informed me it might increase my risk of skin cancer, etc), the anxiety I have surrounding pregnancy and childbirth, that motherhood doesn't speak to me, that it doesn't fit my lifestyle, and that IF I'd change my mind (which I won't do) I'd want to go for adoption anyway because why make more babies if there are so many of them that need a family already. 

Also mentioned that I had looked into different procedures and forms that had to be filled in, and asked her for advice on what would be the best for my body and with regards to safety, because the Essure procedure spoke to me (I'm terrified of anesthesia) but I also read negative reviews about it. So I basically asked for how to proceed to get a safe sterilization, rather than asking if I could get sterilized.
