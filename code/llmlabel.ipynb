      "content=\"Essure is a permanent form of birth control for women that involves the insertion of small, flexible coils into the fallopian tubes. These coils cause scar tissue to form around them, blocking the tubes and preventing sperm from reaching the eggs. This method of contraception is non-hormonal and does not require surgery, as it can be done in a doctor's office without the need for anesthesia.\\n\\nEssure was marketed as a safe and effective alternative to traditional forms of birth control such as tubal ligation or the use of hormonal contraceptives. However, in recent years, there have been reports of serious side effects and complications associated with Essure, including chronic pain, migration of the coils, and allergic reactions. As a result, the device has been taken off the market in many countries and is no longer recommended as a form of birth control.\\n\\nMany women who have experienced negative side effects from Essure have filed lawsuits against the manufacturer, Bayer, claiming that they were not adequately warned about the risks associated with the device. In response to these concerns, the FDA has issued warnings and restrictions on the use of Essure, and some countries have banned its use altogether.\" additional_kwargs={} response_metadata={'token_usage': <OpenAIObject at 0x147386f40> JSON: {\n",

      "Error in Submission row: I just need to get this off my chest:I'm almost 32, been in a great relationship with a guy for about a year and a half. prior to that I was single and having a lot of single fun for about 6 months( which led me to get genital warts, but that's a story for another day, sigh) and prior to THAT, I was with a guy/married for 13 years. That guy was my high school boyfriend. A whole lot of mental illness on his part, infidelity on both parts, and mental mindfuckery from both of us led to the breakdown of that marriage. In 2006, at age 25, I got Essure sterilization, because of a prior abortion and a prior miscarriage, at the time I felt like it was the best thing to do, because I was not in a state at that time to have children, ex didnt want them, I thought I didnt either. Now since my 30s have hit, baby rabies is in full effect. Every goddamn month when I'm ovulating, it's at it's worst, but honestly not a day goes by where I don't mourn the loss of my fertility, and honestly the loss of my marriage. That man was all wrong for me, but now I find myself taking these very issues out on my current partner, and it's not fair. He is the type to want a long term relationship, we live together, but adamantly does not want marriage, because he feels that logically it is not the governments place to say whether we love each other, that a piece of paper doesn't define us, and a whole lot of logic that while it makes sense absolutely crushes me. He also is not opposed to having children, but knew from the get go with me that I am sterile so having them is just not a priority or concern for him. He says, also logically, that coming up with 7000 dollars for Essure reversal is not affordable. I just can't stop feeling sad, and hormonal as fuck all the time. Especially after we have sex. I think this is so nice, please marry me and give me babies, but I know that he doesn't want the former and the latter is not financially possible. Basically I just need to vent, also to ask if anyone has any ideas about how to get my fucking hormones to shut the hell up so that I can relax and enjoy the otherwise happy ride that is this life with this man.\n",

He just nodded in a condescending way and seemingly took everything I said with a grain of salt( I didn't feel as though I was taken seriously).
